# Fixing Pipeline Failures Due to Incorrect Assets Performance Test Configuration


This knowledge base article provides a solution for pipeline failures that occur when the assets performance test is incorrectly included in the Cloud Manager configuration.

## Description {#description}

In scenarios where an assets performance test is not needed, its inclusion in the Cloud Manager pipeline configuration can lead to failures, particularly when the assets KPIs are not set or an author URL is invalid or not intended for use.

## Resolution {#resolution}


To correct this issue, the following steps should be taken:
1. Access the Cloud Manager configuration and locate the assets performance test settings.
2. Remove or disable the assets performance test from the pipeline configuration if it is not applicable to your purchased solutions or current setup.
3. Confirm that no valid author URL is needed for your specific requirements, and adjust the configuration accordingly if necessary.
4. Once the configuration is updated, rerun the pipeline to ensure that it executes without including the unnecessary assets performance test and completes without errors.
