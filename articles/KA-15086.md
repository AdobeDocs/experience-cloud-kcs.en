# Campaign Standard - ACS API development question on creation/updation of profiles


This article describes how to implement Adobe Campaign Standard API to create/update profiles using the method described in the [this documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-standard/using/working-with-apis/managing-profiles/updating-profiles.html?lang=en).

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Standard

### Issue/Symptoms

The following question arises regarding the implementation of ACS API to create/update profiles using the method described in [this documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-standard/using/working-with-apis/managing-profiles/updating-profiles.html?lang=en):  
  
 There is a simpler way explained below (for reference, an attribute `cusId` has been defined as the key on the profile table):
  
<b>Option 1:</b> When we PATCH using [https://\*.adobe.\*/instanceURL/campaign/profileAndServicesExt/profile](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://mc.adobe.io/unilever-mkt-stage1/campaign/profileAndServicesExt/profile&amp;data=02%7c01%7c%7c7ae64aa57f294ebc9d7d08d4bd48ea2f%7cfa7b1b5a7b34438794aed2c178decee1%7c0%7c0%7c636341568263078022&amp;sdata=EVqAIvzLyFYiHf18eFGtnFm9ya/lLg2YfH5T3xer/9E%3D&amp;reserved=0) and include an existing `cusCustomerId,` the profile will be updated.
  
<b>Option 2: </b>Similarly, when we PATCH using *https://\*.adobe.\*/instanceURLcampaign/profileAndServicesExt/profile/@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx* the profile will also be updated.

In Option 2, you won't need to use the `cusId`, but you'll need the profile `Pkey.` However, as `cusId` will always be populated, you will observe that you can always use this field.
  
 Option 1 would be the preferred way as this makes the logic much simpler.
  
<b>Question:</b> Since option 1 is not documented, please confirm if option 1 is supported?


## Resolution {#resolution}


Since `cusId` is a business key in profile, this field can be used to retrieve the entity. And indeed, the PATCH will also work. But the following limitations should be communicated:

- By using the `cusId` field as a key, the field cannot be modified using a PATCH.
- DO NOT build URLs for collections.


Thus, using the `cusId` field will work for top-level profile resources `(/rest/.../profile/< cusId >)`<b>, </b>but if you want to get the subscriptions of a profile, you must go through the REST API:

- GET `/rest/.../profile/<cusId>`
- GET `/href/of/the/subscription/collection/returned/by/the/previous/call`
