## Resolution {#resolution}


The given error states that key in the signal can only contain double-quotes ("), dot (.), hyphen (-) and underscore(_).

Upon looking at the signals closely, it was identified that it contains one space as highlighted below due to which trait validation was failing.

Selecting correct signal condition is really important.
