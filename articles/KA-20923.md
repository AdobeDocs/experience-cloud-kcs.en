## Resolution


The issue can have two different and unrelated root causes:



1. It was found that the issue could be caused by having a custom CORS config in the environment 1

1 Current configuration:


```
{"supportscredentials":true,"supportedmethods":"GET","HEAD","POST","maxage:Integer":86400,"alloworigin":"*","supportedheaders":"*","allowedpaths":".*"}
```


After removing the configuration, the Content Fragments Console was accessible.



2. The second root cause for the same issue was due to the OSGi configuration of the Day CQ Link Externalizer which was changing the Content Fragments Console URL as per below:

from [https://experience.adobe.com/?repo=author-pxxxxx-eyyyyyy.adobeaemcloud.com#/@customer_name/aem/cf/admin/](https://experience.adobe.com/?repo=author-pxxxxx-eyyyyyy.adobeaemcloud.com#/@customer_name/aem/cf/admin/)

to [https://experience.adobe.com/?repo=author-environment.com#/@customer_name/aem/cf/admin/](https://experience.adobe.com/?repo=author-environment.com#/@customer_name/aem/cf/admin/)



The Content Fragments Console was accessible after updating the externalizer configuration to the correct author URL.
