# Enable Twitter ID synchronization:Twitter API returned a 401 (Unauthorized), This request is not properly authenticated.

## Description

Getting error while enabling Twitter Tailored Audiences ID Synchronization.

## Resolution

Currently the only way to add a Campaign Audience is to use a Read Audience activity in a workflow.

This ability did exist previously for Dataplatform audiences however this functionality is not longer supported and is to be removed from the application.
