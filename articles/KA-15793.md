# Campaign Standard - Delivery summary report doesn't fetch data

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Campaign
 Adobe Campaign Standard

<b>Issue</b>
 No data comes into the delivery summary report.

<b>Cause</b>
 Check if you see the error:


```
Unable to render visualization: Please check your columns and rows to ensure they contain valid components
```


This may be related to the configuration issue with the instance due to which it is unable to fetch reports from the server.


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>
Contact Adobe Support to check the value of the option value `Realtime_Reporting_Server_URL`. It should not be *empty*.

`Realtime_Reporting_Server_URL` value for APAC should be [https://reportingservicena.campaign.adobe.com](https://reportingservicena.campaign.adobe.com) and for EMEA, it should be [https://reportingserviceemea.campaign.adobe.com](https://reportingservicena.campaign.adobe.com).

<b>This option is created with an empty value by default and set to the correct value at the time of the instance provisioning.</b>
