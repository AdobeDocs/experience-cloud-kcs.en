# Campaign Standard - Delivery summary report doesn't fetch data

## Description


No data is coming in the delivery summary report. What is the reason?


## Resolution


Check if the error is encountered: "<b>Unable to render visualization: Please check your columns and rows to ensure they contain valid components</b>."

This may be related to the configuration issue with the instance due to which it is unable to fetch reports from the server.

Contact Adobe Support to check the value of the option value "Realtime_Reporting_Server_URL". It should not be empty.

Realtime_Reporting_Server_URL value for APAC should be [https://reportingservicena.campaign.adobe.com](https://reportingservicena.campaign.adobe.com) and for EMEA, it should be [https://reportingserviceemea.campaign.adobe.com](https://reportingservicena.campaign.adobe.com).

<b>This option is created with an empty value by default and set to the correct value at the time of the instance provisioning.</b>
