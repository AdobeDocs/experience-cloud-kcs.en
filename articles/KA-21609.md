# Support for selected file formats by AEM Assets

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

- Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)

- Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service (AEMaaCS)

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

This article addresses questions around support for file formats by AEM Assets in the following Cloud Service document:

https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/file-format-support.html%3Flang%3Den:


1. What does it mean -- in terms of SLA, contract, scope of support by Adobe, Adobe security services -- when a format is used/hosted on AEMaaCS Assets but the format is officially not supported by AEM Assets?
2. What are the risks/implications of using unsupported asset file formats in cloud as per the abovementioned document?



## Resolution {#resolution}


Nothing is different in terms of SLA/risk. A customer can technically upload and store any files in AEMaaCS.

The support is for processing the assets. This means that for unsupported file types, the asset will be uploaded and processing will not consider it.

On AEMaaCS, the same security controls are applied to stored/uploaded assets of unsupported types, such as webp, csv, etc.
