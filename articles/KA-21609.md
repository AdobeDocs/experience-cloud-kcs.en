# Support for selected file formats by AEM Assets

 Questions around support for file formats by AEM Assets in Cloud Service document 1

1 https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/file-format-support.html%3Flang%3Den:

 1) What does it mean in terms of SLA, contract, scope of support by Adobe, Adobe security services, when a format is used/hosted on AEMaaCS Assets but the format is officially not supported by AEM Assets?
 2) What are the risks/implications of using not-supported asset file formats in cloud as per document 1 ?


## Resolution {#resolution}


Nothing is different in terms of SLA/risk, a customer can technically upload and store any files in AEMaaCS.

The support is for processing the assets, this means for unsupported file types, the asset will be uploaded and processing will not consider it.

On AEMaaCS the same security controls are applied to stored/uploaded assets of non-supported types (webp, csv, ...)
