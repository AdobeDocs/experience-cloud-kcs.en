### Environment

### Issue/Symptoms

Saving an Audience from a workflow that has a fork activity, throws an error in the Audience when checking count.
 
 The Audience does get created and shows the correct count, but no content is displayed, and you get following error:


```

'linkxxx_xxx_xxx_xxxKey0' attribute unknown (see definition of 'Joined xxx_xxx_xxx_xx2 (temp:audience_85943390)' schema). 'linkxxx_xxx_xxx_xxxKey0' attribute unknown (see definition of 'Joined xxx_xxx_xxx_xx2 (temp:audience_85943390)' schema).>

The path '/linkxxx_xxx_xxxx_xx2/@linkxxx_xxx_xxxx_xx2Key0' is invalid in schema 'Joined xxx_xxx_xxx_xx2 (temp:audience_85943390)'.
