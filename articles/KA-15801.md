# Campaign Standard - Saving an audience from a workflow which has a fork activity, throws an error in the audience

## Description


When we save an audience from a workflow that has a fork activity, it throws an error in the audience when checking count.

 The Audience does get created and shows the correct count, but no content is displayed, and we get following error:
  
*'<b>linkxxx_xxx_xxxx_xxxKey0' attribute unknown (see definition of 'Joined xxx_xxx_xxx_xx2 (temp:audience_85943390)' schema). 'linkxxx_xxx_xxx_xxxKey0' attribute unknown (see definition of 'Joined xxx_xxx_xxx_xx2 (temp:audience_85943390)' schema). 'linkxxx_xxx_xxx_xxxKey0' attribute unknown (see definition of 'Joined xxx_xxx_xxx_xx2 (temp:audience_85943390)' schema).</b>*
  <b>__</b> 
<b>*The path '/linkxxx_xxx_xxxx_xx2/@linkxxx_xxx_xxxx_xx2Key0' is invalid in schema 'Joined xxx_xxx_xxx_xx2 (temp:audience_85943390)'.</b>*
  <b>__</b> 
<b>*XTK-170036 Unable to parse expression 'ToString(linkxxx_xxx_xxxx_xx2/@linkxxx_xxx_xxxx_xx2Key0)'. XTK-170006 Unable to parse expression 'FetchData($(apiVersion) , $(_filter) , $(.) , $(_lineStart) , $(_lineCount) , $(_order))'.</b>*


## Resolution


This is a fully working workaround:

Uncheck <b>Keep all additional data from the main set </b>and <b>Add Line Number</b> activity.

If *Current Run* and *Last Run* are used later, you can add them again in additional data.
