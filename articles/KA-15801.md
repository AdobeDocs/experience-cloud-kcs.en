# Campaign Standard - Saving an audience from a workflow which has a [!UICONTROL fork] activity, throws an error in the audience

## Description


When we save an audience from a workflow that has a [!UICONTROL fork] activity, it throws an error in the audience when checking count.

The Audience does get created and shows the correct count, but no content is displayed, and we get following error:
 
*'<b>linkxxx_xxx_xxxx_xxxKey0' attribute unknown (see definition of 'Joined xxx_xxx_xxx_xx2 (temp:audience_85943390)' schema). 'linkxxx_xxx_xxx_xxxKey0' attribute unknown (see definition of 'Joined xxx_xxx_xxx_xx2 (temp:audience_85943390)' schema). 'linkxxx_xxx_xxx_xxxKey0' attribute unknown (see definition of 'Joined xxx_xxx_xxx_xx2 (temp:audience_85943390)' schema).</b>*
 <b>____ 
<b>*The path '/linkxxx_xxx_xxxx_xx2/@linkxxx_xxx_xxxx_xx2Key0' is invalid in schema 'Joined xxx_xxx_xxx_xx2 (temp:audience_85943390)'.</b><ex id="6"/>
 <b><ex id="5"/></b> 
<b>*XTK-170036 Unable to parse expression 'ToString(linkxxx_xxx_xxxx_xx2/@linkxxx_xxx_xxxx_xx2Key0)'. XTK-170006 Unable to parse expression 'FetchData($(apiVersion) , $(_filter) , $(.) , $(_lineStart) , $(_lineCount) , $(_order))'.</b><ex id="9"/></b>**


## Resolution


This is a fully working workaround:

Uncheck <b>[!UICONTROL Keep all additional data from the main set] </b>and <b>Add [!UICONTROL Line Number]</b> activity.

If *[!UICONTROL Current Run]* and *[!UICONTROL Last] Run* are used later, you can add them again in additional data.
