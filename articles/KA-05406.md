# How to resolve the error -Empty return for method 'Logon' of service 'xtk:session' for Message Centre technical workflow

## Description


<b>Title</b>: How to resolve the error -Empty return for method 'Logon' of service 'xtk: session' for Message Centre technical workflows failed due to scheduled server restart time



<b>Objective</b>
 Avoid the message center syncing workflows(Message Center execution instance 1 (mcSynch_mcExec1)) keep failing with the error Â "Empty return for method 'Logon' of service 'xtk: session'" at marking instance.
 This error is because the RT server is starting at the same time, which caused the issue since marketing would not be able to connect to RT.


## Resolution


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Campaign Classic

<b>Steps </b>
 Steps to fix the issue:

 1- Verify the Technical workflow's logs to see the time error occurs.
 2- If the time for the error and server restart is the same , modify the scheduler of the Marketing side workflows(mcSynch_mcExec) to change the start time to 5 or 10 minutes after server restart
