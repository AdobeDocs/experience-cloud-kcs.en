# Automated personalization evenly distributes traffic

## Description


<b>Environment</b>

Target



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Either the traffic is already evenly distributed among Activity Offers instead of personalized distribution, or it goes from optimized distribution to even distribution when new offers are added to one of the [!UICONTROL Automated Personalization] activities.


## Resolution


- The system randomly serves offers when there are no personalized models available. This happens if modeling groups have  50 conversions.
- Let's suppose there are four modeling groups - out of which only one modeling group has  50 conversions/model built, and the remaining three modeling groups have no model built (because of not meeting minimum conversion criteria). Then the system will randomly serve offers as there is not enough conversion data to personalize across offers.
