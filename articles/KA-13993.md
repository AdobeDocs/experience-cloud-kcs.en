# Automated personalization activity is evenly distributing the traffic within offers instead of optimized content

## Description


Customer notices that the traffic is evenly distributed among Activity Offers instead of personalized distribution

OR

The client had added new offers to one of the AP activities and started noticing that started noticing that the distribution across multiple offers went from having optimized distribution to even distribution.


## Resolution


- The system randomly serves offers when there are no personalized models available.This happens if modeling groups have  50 conversions.
- Lets suppose, there are 4 modeling groups - out which only one modeling group has  50 conversions/model built and remaining 3 modeling groups have no model built (because of not meeting min conversion criteria). Then system will randomly serve offers as there is only 1 model as there is not enough conversion data to personalize across offers.
