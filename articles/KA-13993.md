# Automated personalization evenly distributes traffic within offers instead of optimized content

## Description


Either the traffic is already evenly distributed among Activity Offers instead of personalized distribution, or it goes from optimized distribution to even distribution when new offers are added to one of the Automated Personalization activities.


## Resolution


- The system randomly serves offers when there are no personalized models available. This happens if modeling groups have  50 conversions.
- Let's suppose there are 4 modeling groups - out of which only one modeling group has  50 conversions/model built, and the remaining 3 modeling groups have no model built (because of not meeting min. conversion criteria). Then the system will randomly serve offers as there is not enough conversion data to personalize across offers.
