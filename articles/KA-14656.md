# Campaign Classic: Delivery approval issue


You are facing a delivery approval issue in Campaign Classic. Delivery is sent with getting content approval. Check all the approval tags in the XML before sending it through.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Campaign Classic

### Issue/Symptoms

Delivery is sent to the recipients without getting content approval when the option is checked and the operator group is assigned.

The delivery in question shows that while the content approval was turned on, the delivery was sent out without getting approval since no approval logs are there in the delivery dashboard.


## Resolution {#resolution}


If you want to copy deliveries this way, check all approval tags in the XML before sending.

Follow these steps to check approval tags.

1. Open <b>Delivery</b> inside the campaign.
2. Click on the <b>Delivery </b>tab<b>.</b>
3. Right-click on empty space and click <b>Edit XML Source.</b>
4. Find the validation tag previously mentioned, and check if everything is correct.

<br>Cause<br>
The issue occurred because delivery XML is missing a critical argument for content approval (`useContentValidation`) and many others. It's corrupted.

The validation looks like this.


```
<validation useBudgetValidation="0" useFCPValidation="0" useTargetValidation="0">
<content primaryAssignee-cs="Content Approvers (cusContentApprovers)" primaryAssignee-type="1">
<primaryAssignee _operation="none" name="cusContentApprovers" type="1"/>
</content>
</validation>
```


The case where content approval is activated looks like this:


```
<validation assignEdition="0" disableNotification="0" externalValidation="0" sandboxMode="0"
sandboxModeEnforced="0" useBudgetValidation="0" useContentValidation="1"
useExtractionValidation="1" useFCPEmailValidation="0" useFCPPaperValidation="0"
useFCPPhoneValidation="0" useFCPSMSValidation="0" useFCPValidation="0"
useLinkedDeliveryValidation="0" useTargetValidation="0" validationMode="0">
<target>
<validation delay="259200" type="0"/>
<primaryAssignee/>
</target>
<content primaryAssignee-cs="Administrator (admin)" primaryAssignee-id="1055"
primaryAssignee-type="0">
</content>
</validation>
```


This can happen during an incorrect copy of the delivery, which is not recommended. It's recommended to use a delivery template or create a new one.

How is it known that it's a copy?
