# AEM Email Templates not getting synced with Adobe Campaign.

## Description

When a user tries to copy and paste the site's template on which the [!UICONTROL Campaign approval] workflow is already executed, The `cq:acLinks` and `cq:acUUID` properties for Adobe Campaign are not removed during copy and paste operation.
<br> <br><br>Due to this, the Adobe Campaign is not able to sync the Email template from AEM and gives up an error: Duplicate acUUID found as `cq:acLinks` and `cq:acUUID` properties are unique properties.
<br> <br><br><b>Steps to Reproduce:</b>
<br>1: Create a Site’s Email Template in AEM.
<br>2: [!UICONTROL Campaign approval] workflow.
<br>3: Approve the template by completing the workflow steps.
<br>4: Navigate to crx/de.
<br>5: The copy/pasted template will contain `cq:acLinks` and `cq:acUUID` properties.

<b>Errors in the Logs:</b>
<br>No related errors can be found in the error logs.<br><br> <br><br><b>Properties of Template in crx/de After Copy-paste operation:</b><br><br> <br><br><b>Experienced Behaviour  :</b><br><br> <br><br>![](assets/___6aa1eeb9-bbd6-ec11-a7b5-000d3a3adbfc___.jpeg)<br><br> <br><br><b>Expected Behaviour:</b>

## Resolution


The `campaign-property-modification-service` is a service user which is used for modifying properties of campaign newsletter on copy and paste function.
 This `usercampaign-property-modification-service` should have read and modify permissions on the content folder.

If it doesn’t have read and modify permissions on the content folder, it can’t clean up the `cq:acLinks` and `cq:acUUID` properties of the copy-pasted site template.

After providing the user necessary permissions, the properties get cleaned up.
