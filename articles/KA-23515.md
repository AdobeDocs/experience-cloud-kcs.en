# AEM 6.5 Service Pack is not installing

## Description {#description}


<b>Description</b> :

When attempting to upgrade an AEM instance to a newer version, one of the instances (it could be the author or one of the publish instances) cannot be upgraded.
 During the upgrade process, the package manager gives the impression that the service pack is installing, however, no messages were being written to the log file, and at the end, the /system/console/productinfo screen still shows the older service pack version.


## Resolution {#resolution}


1. Log in to the affected author/publish instance and navigate to CRXDE Lite (under Tools `>`  General)
2. In crx/de navigate to /libs/system/aem-service-pckg-6.5.15 (the SP which is currently showing as installed)
3. Expand the SP15 folder, delete the "install" folder, and click Save All
4. Stop the affected author/publish instance
5. Navigate to where the affected author/publish server instance /crx-quickstart/launchpad/installer location is, and delete all the files in this location.
6. Start the affected author/publish instance
7. Once the instance is stable, upload the new Service Pack and install it.
