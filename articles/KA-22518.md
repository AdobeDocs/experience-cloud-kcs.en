# XLS and XLSX files show error on DAM

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)

### Issue/Symptoms

When viewing on an Excel file (`.xls` and `.xlsx`) in AEM DAM (Digital asset management) the file is not visible.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Add <b>xls</b> and <b>xlsx </b>to your filters definition file as following:

`/0010 { /type "allow" /extension '(css|eot|gif|ico|jpeg|jpg|js|gif|pdf|png|svg|swf|ttf|woff|woff2|html|mp4|ogg|zip|json|rss|exe|xls|xlsx)' /path "/content/*" }`
<br>Cause<br>
The filters file on the dispatcher can block unknown file types.
