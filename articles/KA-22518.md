# Office Documents (docx, xlsx, etc) files show 404 on DAM


This article resolves the AEM issue where an MS Office document is not visible when viewing it in DAM (Digital Asset Management). To correct the resulting 404 error, you need to update the `filters.any`Â file in your dispatcher configuration to allow the appropriate file extension.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)

### Issue/Symptoms

When viewing an MS Office document (i.e. `.xls`, `.xlsx`, doc, docx, etc) in AEM DAM (Digital Asset Management) the file is not visible and throws a 404. The dispatcher logs will show that the file is blocked.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Add the appropriate file extension (i.e. `xls` and `xlsx`) to your filters definition file as following:

Update the `filters.any` or custom filters file in your dispatcher configuration instead of the default file to allow the appropriate file extension. By default, the dispatcher will block these.

To implement this change for a `doc` or `docx` file for example, add the following filter rule to your `filters.any` file:


```
# Allow .doc and .docx file types from DAM
/0099 { /type "allow" /extension '(doc|docx)' /path "/content/dam/*" }
```


This rule will enable access to Word documents stored within the DAM. Since you are using AEM as a Cloud Service, here are the steps to apply this change:

1. Add the provided rule to your `filters.any` or custom filter file within your code repository.
2. Commit and push the changes to your version control system.
3. Run the Cloud Manager pipeline to deploy your changes to the AEM as a Cloud Service environment.


### Cause

The filters file on the dispatcher can block unknown file types.
