## Resolution {#resolution}


This failure can be caused by trying to upload a 0-byte asset as one of the conditions in the below function`[` 0`]`  was not met.

Look for any 0-byte files or the other conditions detailed in the following function.`[` 0`]`

Once you remove the 0-byte asset from the containing folder the rest of the assets should be uploaded successfully.

The required conditions when uploading a file are having:

1. fileName
2. fileSize
3. filePath
4. blob


`[` 0`]`


```none
function ensureRequiredOptions(options) {
                if(!options.fileName || !options.fileSize || (!options.filePath && (!options.blob || !options.blob.slice))) {
                    throw new UploadError('UploadFile missing required fields. Must have fileName, fileSize, and either filePath or blob', ErrorCodes.INVALID_OPTIONS);
                    }
            }
```
