# Campaign Classic V7 - Can the execution time of a WAIT activity be changed when a workflow is running?

## Description

<br>Environment<br><br>
- Campaign Classic
- Campaign



<br><br>Issue/Symptoms<br><br>
Can the execution time of a WAIT Timer activity be changed when a workflow is in the running mode?

<b>For example:</b>

Let's assume a workflow is scheduled to be executed in <b>X </b>days and it got triggered after <b>Y</b> Days. How is it possible?


## Resolution

We can change the timing of a workflow when it's running by following the approach given below<br>
<b>A.</b>  If the workflow is running, and it has not reached the WAIT activity and then, we can pause the workflow, make the amendments and then restart it.

<b>*For example</b>*: Let’s assume the workflow is running and currently at some activity before the WAIT activity.

Then if we pause the workflow, make the amendments, and then restart it, the new Wait would get effective.

<b>B.</b>   If the workflow is running, and it has reached the WAIT activity, then stop the workflow, make the amendments, and then restart it.

<b>*For example:</b>* Let’s say the workflow is running and currently at the WAIT activity which is scheduled to have a wait activity of let’s say 1 day.

Then you must stop the workflow, make the amendments to let’s say <b>WAIT=2</b> days and then restart it.

Always restart the workflow to take into account changes made to workflow activities. Otherwise they will not apply.
