# Why is there sometimes surge in number of files sent by Data Feeds?

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Customer Journey Analytics
- Analytics



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
There is sometimes a surge in the number of files sent by Data Feeds. For example, it usually sends 10 files in a day.Â  But somedays, it sends 100s of files.


## Resolution


Generally, this is due to settings for Late Arriving Hits being turned on recently. It would appear to the customer that the normal amount of data for the affected hour/day arrived as usual. However, the extra large amount of data sent by data feeds were for previous hours and dates.

For the report suite that has had late hits turned on already for more than 24 hours, the first feed request after it is turned on will do a 24-hour backfill of export files.
