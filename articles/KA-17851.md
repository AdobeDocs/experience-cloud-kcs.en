# Sent targeted A/B test stuck at Sending (Reply)


This article explains a workaround and cause of the Adobe Campaign Standard issue where a targeted A/B test is stuck at *Sending.*To resolve this, you need to set aggregation to *none*.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Campaign Standard

### <b>Issue</b>

When sending subject-based A/B tests, the target size is flagged as a warning that it is too small (no documentation mentions minimum target sizes).

The winning variant was manually selected when the follow-up deliveries weren't picking a winner.

The initial balance of customers was sent, but the two follow-up deliveries are now stuck in Sending (reply) status and will not send, with 43% of our sends stuck.


## Resolution {#resolution}


### <b>Workaround</b>

If you set the aggregation to *none*, the A/B test would not face the above issue.

### <b>Cause</b>

- Your customer has a recurring A/B Test delivery fed to the population from a workflow.
- The learning population is set as 5% per variant, and there are two variants with a learning period of 45 minutes.
- The 57% population is the initial population on which the A/B test has run; after that winner has been pushed.
- The aggregation period of the delivery is 24 hours, which is why the population is still being added to the delivery even after completing the A/B test.
- The product has a limitation in that the subsequent population doesn't get scheduled when the winner has been pushed.


This is reported as a low-priority bug in ticket CAMP-47125.
