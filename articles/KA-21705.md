# Non-admin users are unable to get data for specific eVars

## Description {#description}


<b>Description</b> :

Non-admin users see an error below and no data is shown when they try to get data for specific eVars in Analysis Workspace even if they are assigned a product profile that includes access to the specific eVars for the specific report suite.
 You do not have access to the dimension for this request.


## Resolution {#resolution}


This would happen if the eVars are mapped to dimensions used for Media Analytics.
 Admin users can check the settings in the Media Reporting page.  Please refer to the help page below for more information.
[https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/media-analytics/using/media-reports/media-reports-enable.html?lang=en](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/media-analytics/using/media-reports/media-reports-enable.html?lang=en)
  
 If this is the case, there are two options below to resolve this issue.

- Admin users can assign the dimensions used for Media Analytics, such as Content and Content Type, to the product profile in question.
- Admin users can change the mappings of the dimensions used for Media Analytics to different variables in the Media Reporting page, if you don't mind.  For example, you can change the mapping from eVar11 to a different variable, say eVar13, for Content dimension in the case below.
