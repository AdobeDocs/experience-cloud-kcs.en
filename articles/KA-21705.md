# Non-admin users are unable to get data for specific eVars


This article provides a detailed overview on why non-admin users are unable to get data for specific eVars in Adobe Analytics. Admin users can assign dimension or map the dimension to the Media Analytics workspace.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Analytics

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Non-admin users see the following error with no data shown when they try to get data for specific *eVars* in the Adobe Analytics workspace:

*"You do not have access to the dimension for this request"*

This occurs even if they are assigned a product profile that includes access to the specific *eVars* for the specific report suite.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The issue occurs if the *eVars* are mapped to dimensions used for <b>Media Analytics. </b>

Admin users can check the settings on the <b>Media Reporting</b> page. Refer to the [Media reports enablement](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/media-analytics/using/media-reports/media-reports-enable.html?lang=en) documentation for more information.

If this is the case, there are two options below to resolve this issue.

- Admin users can assign the dimensions used for <b>Media Analytics</b>, such as <b>Content</b> and <b>Content Type</b>, to the product profile in question.
- Admin users can change the mappings of the dimensions used for <b>Media Analytics</b> to different variables on the <b>Media Reporting</b> page. For example, you can change the mapping from eVar11 to a different variable, say eVar13, for the <b>Content</b> dimension in the case below.
