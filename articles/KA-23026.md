# AEP - Streaming profile updates fail when the source schema is non-XDM compliant


*Upsert* refers to the process of enabling a dataset with *upsert*capabilities to make updates to Real-Time Customer Profile data.

See more information in this documentation: [Enable a dataset for profile updates using APIs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/catalog/datasets/enable-upsert.html)

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Experience Platform

### Issue/Symptoms

While streaming profile upsert, you may observe that the dataflow fails if the source schema is non-XDM compliant.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Note that the Streaming upserts work <u>only if the source schema is XDM compatible</u>.
