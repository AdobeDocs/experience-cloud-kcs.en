# AEP - Streaming profile updates fail when the source schema is non-XDM compliant


When talking about 'upsert', we are referring to the process of enabling a dataset with “upsert” capabilities in order to make updates to Real-Time Customer Profile data

See more information in this documentation: [https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/catalog/datasets/enable-upsert.html](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/catalog/datasets/enable-upsert.html)

## Description {#description}

For streaming profile upsert, you may observe that the dataflow fails if the source schema is non-XDM compliant. 

## Resolution {#resolution}


Note the Streaming upserts work <u>only if the source schema is XDM compatible</u>.
