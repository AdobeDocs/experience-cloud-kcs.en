# AEP - Streaming profile updates fail when the source schema is non-XDM compliant


When talking about 'upsert', we are referring to the process of enabling a dataset with “upsert” capabilities in order to make updates to Real-Time Customer Profile data.

See more information in this documentation: [Enable a dataset for profile updates using APIs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/catalog/datasets/enable-upsert.html)

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Experience Platform

### Issue/Symptoms
<br>While streaming profile upsert, you may observe that the dataflow fails if the source schema is non-XDM compliant. 

## Resolution {#resolution}


Note the Streaming upserts work <u>only if the source schema is XDM compatible</u>.

For more information about streaming upserts in [Data Prep](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/data-prep/home.html), please see [Stream Upserts in our Data Prep Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/data-prep/upserts.html).
