# How to capture SSAI and Original Manifests Simultaneously

## Description

<br>How to capture SSAI and Original Manifests Simultaneously<br><br>



## Resolution




1. Setup your [!DNL Charles] recording settings to only capture m3u8, using the method suggested in this screenshot:  2. On an [!DNL Apple] TV, start playback on the app(for which you need to debug) and capture in [!DNL Charles] (requires setting up [!DNL Apple] TV with [!DNL Apple] TV Configurator in advance) – make sure of that beforehand.  3. Grab the SSAI bootstrap or master playlist URL –http://manifest.auditude.com - Take the encoded m3u8 URL (highlighted in blue)  4. base64 decode the stream URL (using [https://www.base64decode.org/](https://www.base64decode.org/)) to get the original stream URL or use the terminal command  5. In [!DNL Charles], turn on macOS or [!DNL Windows] proxy 6. Open [!DNL Safari] or [!DNL Edge] browser, enter the base64-<b>decoded</b> URL. Let the video play long enough for a couple of manifests from this master playlist to appear in [!DNL Charles]. They will look like the highlighted lines in this screenshot  7. Once you have this captured from the [!DNL Safari] or [!DNL Edge] browser, you can exit that browser. It is recommended tp capture this stream in a new session.  8. In [!DNL Charles], select the corresponding original media playlist (same one that you're requesting for SSAI)   9.Right-click in [!DNL Charles] - <b>Repeat Advanced</b>  10. In the setup window, the repeat interval is in MILLISECONDS (e.g. so please use <b>6000</b> for 6 seconds - or as you like) for repetitions, you can put <b>1000</b>.  Keeping the “Show results in new Session” box checked ON – which will create a separate tab that will call for an original manifest every 6 seconds, and will create a capture of the original.   11. Final Step - Turn off macOS/ [!DNL Windows] proxy.
