# Mitigating Log4j2 vulnerabilities for AEM Forms


To mitigate the Log4j2 vulnerability install the latest service pack or use manual mitigation steps.

## Description {#description}


<b>Note</b>: AEM 6.5.13.0 Forms and earlier releases includes both Log4j libraries (1.x and 2.17.1). The AEM Forms Log4j 1.x libraries in AEM 6.5.13.0 Forms and earlier releases are not part of the vulnerability reported nor are they noted as vulnerable in AEM Forms code scans performed by Adobe. However, all Log4j 1.x library are removed in the 6.5.14 release. For instructions to install AEM 6.5.14.0 or a later release, see [Adobe Experience Manager 6.5 Latest Service Pack release notes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/release-notes/release-notes.html).

Critical security vulnerabilities have been reported for Apache Log4j2, a popular logging library for Java-based applications. The following vulnerabilities have been analyzed:

## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Note</b>:

- Replace the original copy of the log4j-core-2.xx jar with the updated copy. No other changes are required.
- When the configuration manager is run again, contents of `<` `FORMS_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY>/configurationManager/export` can be overwritten. To avoid re-doing the above change each time this happens, update the jar in `<` `FORMS_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY>/deploy/adobe-core-[ jboss|weblogic|websphere] .ear.` This ensures that the adobe-livecycle-`[` jboss|weblogic|websphere`]` .ear produced by configuration manager already has the updated log4j-core-2.xx jar.
- Manual modifications to deployable artifacts can be overwritten on patching/upgrade. If this happens, reapply the procedure.


Use one of the following methods detailed below to mitigate the risk of this vulnerability:

- Install the latest service pack
- Use manual mitigation steps


<b>Install the latest service pack</b>

<b>Caution: If you have applied a hotfix on the Experience Manager Forms Service Pack 6.3.3.8 or Experience Manager Forms Service Pack 6.4.8.4 environment, do not install the service pack with the vulnerabilities fixes (listed below). Installing these service packs may overwrite the hotfix. Adobe recommends using manual mitigation steps in such a scenario.</b>


| <b>Release</b> | <b>Version  </b> | <b>Download link/User action</b> |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Experience Manager 6.5 Forms on JEE | AEMForms-6.5.0-0038 (log4jv2.16) | Download from [Software Distribution](https://experience.adobe.com/downloads).  <br><br><br> |
| Experience Manager 6.4 Forms on JEE   | AEM Forms-6.4.0-0027 |
| Experience Manager 6.3 Forms on JEE  | AEMForms-6.3.0-0047 |
| Experience Manager 6.5 Forms Designer | AEM Forms Designer v650.019 |
| Experience Manager 6.4 Forms Designer | AEM Forms Designer v640.012 |
| Automated Forms Conversion Service | The mitigation steps were identified and the service was patched. | There is no user action. |


<b>Use manual mitigation steps</b>

To mitigate the issue, for Experience Manager 6.5 Forms (log4j-core version 2.10 and later), Experience Manager 6.4 Forms (log4j-core version earlier than 2.10), and Experience Manager 6.3 Forms (log4j-core version earlier than 2.10), perform the following steps:

1. Shut down all the server instances and locators.
2. Remove <b>org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class</b> from the vulnerable log4j-core-2.xx.jar available at the following locations:


- Deployable EAR:

    `<` `FORMS_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY>/configurationManager/export/adobe-livecycle-[ jboss|weblogic|websphere] .ear`
- GemFire or Geode locator:

    `<` `FORMS_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY>``/lib/caching/lib`


To update Deployable EAR, depending on your operating system, you can use one of the following methods to remove the <b>JndiLookup.class</b> from the vulnerable log4j-core-2.xx.jar:

- (Linux with Oracle WebLogic or Redhat JBoss): Run the following command. Update the `<` version`>`  and application server information before running these commands:
    - `unzip adobe-livecycle-.ear lib/log4j-core-.jar`
    - `zip -d lib/log4j-core-xxx.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class`
    - `zip -ru adobe-livecycle-jboss.ear lib/log4j-core-.jar`
- (Linux with IBM WebSphere): Run the following command. Update the `<` version`>`  and application server information before running these commands:
    - `unzip adobe-livecycle-websphere.ear log4j-core-.jar`
    - `zip -d log4j-core-xxx.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class`
- (Microsoft Windows): Use a GUI (graphical user interface) tool like [7-ZIP](https://www.7-zip.org/) to remove the class file.


1. Repeat step 2 for each application server instance (node) and all locators (if more than one).
2. After updating the jar, redeploy the modified EAR (Enterprise Application aRchive) and restart all locator processes and server instances.
