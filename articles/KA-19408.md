# How can you export Quarantines per country

## Description

How can you export Quarantines per country?

## Resolution


- Quarantines are in table  NmsAddressStatus
   - They are linked to the last delivery but not to any profile
   - They contain the “normalized” recipient address (e.g. lower case for Email / + prefix for mobile phone)
- There is 2 options to link them to profiles
   - Join to profile via the address field on the AddressStatus and Email/mobilePhone on the profile
      - Would not return those records where the address is not normalized on the profile level
   - Join to [!DNL profile] via looking up all delivery logs (they also contain normalized recipient address) and then join [!DNL profile]
      - Would return only data of last 6 months and nothing for older hard bounces
      - Would return profiles where the recipient address has been changed/corrected already
