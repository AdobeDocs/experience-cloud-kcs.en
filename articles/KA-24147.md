# Pages are not displaying properly on preview


When a page is previewed on the cloud (AEMaaCS) preview environment, the page may appear to not load any CSS, formatting, or experience fragments that are included in the template for the page.

## Description {#description}

When publishing a page to preview, the template is not, by default, also published to preview. This can cause unexpected issues when trying to view the page on the preview environment.

## Resolution {#resolution}


There are several workarounds to ensure that templates are available in the preview environment for testing and validation before going live. The two workarounds are:

<b>Custom Publish Tree Workflow</b>
Access the AEM Workflow Models console.
Copy the default "Publish Tree" workflow to create a new custom workflow model.
Modify the copied workflow to target the preview replication agent instead of the live publish agent.
Save the new workflow model and use it to manually publish templates to the preview environment.

<b>Include Templates in Deployment Package</b>
Alternatively, you can include your templates within a content package that is part of your project's codebase and then use your pipelineÂ to deploy this package to all environments, including the preview environment.

By following either of these steps, you can ensure that templates are available in the preview environment for content authors to work with, facilitating a smoother content staging and review process.
