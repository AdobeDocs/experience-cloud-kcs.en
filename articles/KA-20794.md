# About the retention period of the value when Conversion Variables (eVars) is set to "Never" expiration date.


Learn about the retention period of the value when Conversion Variables (eVars) is set to "Never" expiration date.

## Description {#description}

If I set the expiration date of a conversion variable (eVar) to "Never," how long will it continue to hold its value?

## Resolution {#resolution}


If the expiration date is set to "Never," the cookie will not expire unless the visitor deletes it in their browser. In other words, it will retain its value forever. On the other hand, if the visitor does not revisit the site (does not submit an image request) during the 13 months, the visitor profile is deleted from the server in Adobe Analytics and expires. This means that the eVar value without an expiration date will also be reset.
