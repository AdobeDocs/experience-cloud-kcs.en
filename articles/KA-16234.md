# Unable to use/query against DM delivery output file names

## Description


One of my customer is reported the following issue since they have some different business requirement.

From `mdata` field, we want to extract the outputFile name--see attachment(mData_outputFile.png) for location, stored within `outputFile=" "`. We want to the know best way to transform this xml data type field to be passed as an enriched field within the [!DNL Campaign] workflow so we can append into our promotion history table to store all output file names.

I have first tried to reach out to my colleagues but unfortunately they don’t have much information to the above question. Since, we know that `mdata` is an XML field and not a DB field to query upon it. But, apart from that is there any method to achieve this scenario?


## Resolution


Use a [!UICONTROL File extract] activity to extract the delivery data in XML format.



This will ensure that the mdata is also extracted.



Then you can use a [!UICONTROL Load file] activity or [!UICONTROL JS code] activity to parse that file and get your data.



OR



use a [!UICONTROL JS code] activity and `queryDef` to fetch mdata of your delivery and then parse the xml.



Store data in an instance variable to then load in transition





Customer had a follow up query which was as below --

“We are trying to use the method of `queryDef` against mdata, which we were able to write. For the parse method, what is the recommended approach for it?”



<b>ANSWER --</b>

Your request will be like


```
*queryDef operation="select" schema="nms:delivery"*

*select*

*node expr="@id"/*

*node expr="output/@fileName" label="Output file"/*

*/select*

*sysFilter*

*condition expr="@isModel = 0"/*

*/sysFilter*

*orderBy*

*node expr="@lastModified" sortDesc="true"/*

*/orderBy*

*/queryDef*
```


And it will return
```

*delivery-collection*

*delivery id="11878415"*

*output filename=”abc.txt”*

*/output*

*/delivery*

*/delivery-collection*
```
