# Unable to use/query against DM delivery output file names

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign Classic
- Campaign
- Campaign Standard

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
One of the customers has reported the following issue:

 From mdata field, we want to extract the outputFile name--see attachment(mData_outputFile.png) for location, stored within outputFile=" ". We want to know the best way to transform this *XML data* type field to be passed as an enriched field within the campaign workflow. So that we can append into our promotion history table to store all the output file names.

 Since, we know that mdata is an XML field and not a DB field to query upon it. But is there any method to achieve this scenario?


## Resolution


We can try to resolve this issue in two ways:

1. Use a file extract activity to extract the delivery data in *XML* format. This will ensure that the `mdata` is also extracted. After that, you can use a load file activity or JavaScript (*JS code)* activity to parse that file and get your data.
2. Use a *JS code* activity and `queryDef` to fetch `mdata` of your delivery and then parse the XML. Store data in an <b>instance variable</b> to then load in transition


Customer had a follow up query which was as below:

We are trying to use the method of `queryDef` against `mdata`, which we were able to write. For the parse method, what is the recommended approach?

Answer:

Your request will be like:

*queryDef operation="select" schema="nms:delivery"*

*select*

*node expr="@id"/*

*node expr="output/@fileName" label="Output file"/*

*/select*

*sysFilter*

*condition expr="@isModel = 0"/*

*/sysFilter*

*orderBy*

*node expr="@lastModified" sortDesc="true"/*

*/orderBy*

*/queryDef*



And it will return:

*delivery-collection*

*delivery id="11878415"*

*output filename=”abc.txt”*

*/output*

*/delivery*

*/delivery-collection*
