# Intermittent email notifications delivery while using Classification APIs

## Description


We expect an email notification when the job is done while using Classification API ([https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis/blob/master/docs/classifications-api/methods/r_CreateImport.md](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis/blob/master/docs/classifications-api/methods/r_CreateImport.md "Follow link")), but the delivery of these notifications are intermittent. Here is the reason why these notifications are intermittent.


## Resolution


Our system only triggers email notifications when new Keys are included for the classification which are not classified at all. In case of classifying a Key which is pre-classified will not trigger email notification.
