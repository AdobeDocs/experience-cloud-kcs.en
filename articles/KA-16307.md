# Target - Geo Audience qualification fails

## Description


Geo audience with DMA option in UI does not have a "," separator. This causes audience qualification to fail.


## Resolution


Recommendations:

Re-create the audience using the right geo value in the dropdown and use the same value in their profile script as applicable
 All our edges have been updated with the latest geo information from Digital Envoy. Going forward there will be a weekly sync/update between TNT and Digital Envoy to make sure that our UI has the most up to date geo information for audience creation.
