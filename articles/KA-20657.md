# AEM Manages Services - Provide User Permissions to Access OSGi Console


Learn how to resolve the 403 Forbidden error in AEM Manages Services and grant users access to the OSGi console.

## Description {#description}


The customer wants to grant some users on AEM Managed Services access to the OSGi console at https://author IP`>` /system/console/configMgr.

The users are members of the Admin user group, which has the same permissions as the administrator who can access the console without issue, yet they are unable to access it and receive the error <b>403 Forbidden</b>:


> <b>HTTP ERROR 403 Forbidden</b>
> 
> URI:  /system/console/configMgr
> 
> MESSAGE: Forbidden
> 
> SERVLET: org.apache.felix.http.base.internal.dispatch.DispatcherServlet-2f11b042



## Resolution {#resolution}


The permissions provided are the user permissions and they do not necessarily grant the user access to the OSGi Console.

Please access the OSGi console using the Admin user - `<` IP`>` :`<` PORT`>` /system/console/configMgr, search & edit “Apache Sling Web Console Security Provider” and verify that the group your user is part of is added to the "Group Names".

If the group is not present here, please add it and you will be able to access the OSGi console.
