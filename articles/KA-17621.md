# Handling filters and/or segments with Time Spent metrics

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- Analytics
- Customer Journey Analytics



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
How are filters/segments handled with time spent metrics?


## Resolution {#resolution}

When the report is run:
- the data is gathered for the selected date range
- the time spent values are calculated
- the segment filters the results


Example impact: Since time spent values are allocated before the filter/segment is run, there is a possibility of time spentÂ for pages (a dimension) that don't have visits.
