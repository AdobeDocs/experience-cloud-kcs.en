# Time Spent with Analytics Workspace filters and/or segments

## Description

How are filters / segments handled with time spent metrics?

## Resolution


When the report is run:

- the data is gathered for the selected date range
- the time spent values are calculated
- the segment filters the results


Example impact: since time spent values are allocated before the filter/segment is run, it's possible for there to be time spent for pages (a dimension) that don't have visits.
