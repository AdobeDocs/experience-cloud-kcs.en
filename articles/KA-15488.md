# How to fix "A content model fragment is badly configured." error in ACS delivery.

## Description


Delivery analysis fails with the error "A content model fragment is badly configured.".


## Resolution


A content fragment in the email delivery is breaking the html leading to this error. This is a known issue and a content fragment which was working fine earlier will start throwing error suddenly.

Open the delivery html. Search for "<b>*data-fragment-name</b>*". You will get the content fragment name which is creating this issue.

Go to Resource  Content Fragments and open the erroneous content fragment. Open its html and add a space anywhere and then delete it. So the html remailns as it is. Then save the content fragment.

Try triggering the delivery again. This time it should analyze successfully and will go out.
