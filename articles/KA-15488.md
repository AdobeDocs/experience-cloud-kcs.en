# Error "A content model fragment is badly configured" in ACS delivery


Find and open the erroneous content fragment, and add a space anywhere, and then delete it. Then try triggering the delivery again.

## Description {#description}


<b>Environments</b>
 Adobe Campaign (AC)
 Adobe Campaign Standard (ACS)

<b>Issue</b>
 Delivery analysis fails with the error: *A content model fragment is badly configured.*

<b>Cause</b>
 The reason for this is a content fragment in the email delivery is breaking the html leading to this error.

This is a known issue. A content fragment which was working normally earlier will start throwing the error suddenly.


## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Solution</b>

Follow these steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. Open the delivery HTML. Search for `data-fragment-name`. That will give you the content fragment name that is creating this issue.
2. Go to <b>Resource</b> `>`  <b>Content Fragments</b> and open the erroneous content fragment. Open its HTML and add a space anywhere, and then delete it, so that the HTML does not change (so it remains the same as before you began). Then <b>Save</b> the content fragment.
3. Try triggering the delivery again. This time it should analyze successfully and will go out.
