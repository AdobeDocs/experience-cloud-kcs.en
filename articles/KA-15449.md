# Why do some Analytic schedule project recipients not receive scheduled workspace projects


Learn why some Analytic schedule project recipients do not receive the scheduled workspace projects.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Analytics

### Issue/Symptoms

Occasionally, a recipient of a scheduled report or project may be unsubscribed from the email because of which you are not receiving scheduled workspace projects.


## Resolution {#resolution}


This action is either performed by the recipient directly or in some cases, you can be auto-unsubscribed by your company email server.

Please have your IT/Security team add "adobe.com" and "omniture.com" to the mail server whitelist.

Some anti-phishing filters run all links in an email. If this check includes the unsubscribe link, then this will unsubscribe you.



Additional note:

Adobe Analytics scheduled reports/project unsubscribe requests are not authenticated. This is so you can send reports to non-Adobe Analytics users.
