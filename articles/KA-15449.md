# Why do some recipients not receive scheduled workspace projects?

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Analytics

<b>Issue</b>
 Recipient of a scheduled report or project is unsubscribed from the report or project email.


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>

This action is either performed by the recipient directly or in some cases, users can be auto-unsubscribed by their company email server.

Please have your IT/Security team add `adobe.com` and `omniture.com` to the mail server whitelist.

Some anti-phishing filters run all links in an email. If this check includes the unsubscribe link, this will unsubscribe the user.

<b><u>Note</u>:</b>
Adobe Analytics scheduled reports/projects unsubscribe requests are not authenticated. This is so customers to send reports to non-Adobe Analytics users.
