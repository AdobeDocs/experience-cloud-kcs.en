# What is the difference between Target Visitors and Analytics Visitors?

## Description


Target Visitors Vs Analytics Unique Visitors


## Resolution


The difference between the Target report metric "Visitors" and Analytics report metric "Unique Visitors"Â  is below

<u><b>Target Visitor</b></u> is a participant in the activity, for the life of the campaign.
 Visitor will be counted as a new entrant if he or she visits the site from a new computer or a new browser; deletes the cookie; or converts and returns to the activity with the same cookie. An entrant is identified by the PCID in the visitor's mbox cookie. If the PCID changes, the person is considered a new visitor.

<b>Analytics Unique visitors</b> refers to a visitor who visits a site for the first time within a specified time period. For example, the unique visitor can visit a site ten times in a week, but if the time period is week, a single unique visitor is counted only once for that week .
