# Adobe Campaign: Is adding "with SCHEMABINDING" to Scalar Functions supported for Campaign?

## Description

It has been found that clients using SQLServer can utilize the "with SCHEMABINDING" with the Scalar functions to vastly improve performance.

The question however is whether or not this function is officially supported within Adobe Campaign.

## Resolution

As it stands, an enhancement has been submitted as CAMP-38229 for the Profile search functionality to be able to handle the 1 to 1 relationship.

That said modifying the link type to 1:0 or 0 type link then republishing the changes should allow the profiles to be seen.
