# Unable to create a package using CURL in build 15977/16145


This article discusses a workaround to not being able to create or update packages using CURL commands in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) as a Cloud Service after recent platform updates.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

HTTP 404 errors appear when trying to create and update a package in AEM Cloud environments using CURL commands. The problem emerged after the AEM updates: 2024.4.15977.20240418T174835Z, and affected all cloud environments, including production. Previously, functional CURL commands began to fail, obstructing package creation and updating via the command line.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Adobe is actively working on a permanent fix for this issue. The development team has identified a necessary code change, which will be incorporated into a future release.Â Follow up in a few weeks for information regarding the release vehicle for the associated fix.

In the meantime, there is a workaround to continue managing the packages. The steps for the current workaround are:

1. Upload an empty package:

    ```
    curl -u <user>:<password> -F cmd=upload -F force=true -F package=@test.zip http://localhost:4502/crx/packmgr/service/.json
    ```


2. Build the package:

    ```
    curl -X POST http://localhost:4502/crx/packmgr/service/.json/etc/packages/test.zip?cmd=build
    ```
