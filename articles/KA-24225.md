# Unable to create a package using CURL in build 15977/16145


This article addresses an issue where users were unable to create or update packages using CURL commands in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) as a Cloud Service following recent updates to the platform.

## Description {#description}


Customers experienced HTTP 404 errors when attempting to create and update packages in AEM Cloud environments using CURL commands. The problem emerged after the AEM updates: 2024.4.15977.20240418T174835Z, and it affected all cloud environments, including Production. Previously functional CURL commands began to fail, obstructing package creation and updating via the command line.














## Resolution {#resolution}


Adobe is actively working on a permanent fix for this issue. In the meantime, a workaround has been provided for users to continue managing their packages. The development team has identified a necessary code change, which will be incorporated into a future release. Users should follow up in a few weeks for information regarding the release vehicle for the associated fix. The steps for the current workaround are:

1. Upload an empty package:


    ```
    curl -u <user>:<password> -F cmd=upload -F force=true -F package=@test.zip http://localhost:4502/crx/packmgr/service/.json
    ```
2. Build the package:


    ```
    curl -X POST http://localhost:4502/crx/packmgr/service/.json/etc/packages/test.zip?cmd=build
    ```
