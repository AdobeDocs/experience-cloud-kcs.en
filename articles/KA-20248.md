# How to see/enable 3rd Party ID Syncs with AAM when using the AEP Web SDK

## Description

When using AEP Web SDK instead of AAM DIL, [!DNL Analytics], or [!DNL Visitor ID] service, how do I ensure that AAM's 3rd party ID syncs are still firing? How do I even turn them on?

## Resolution


The same container that is used for legacy ID service is the same container that is used in an AEP Web SDK deployment. However, instead of enabling (or setting it) in ID service, you enable it/set it when creating a new data stream. Details can be found here:

[https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/datastreams/overview.html?lang=en](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/datastreams/overview.html?lang=en)

When configuring the data stream:

1. Expand the "Advanced Options" section
2. Enable the "3rd Party ID Sync" slider.
3. Once enabled, you'll see a text box appear. This allows you to set the container ID. This is where the same container ID that is used in the legacy ID service implementation would be set. By and large, this value will just be 0. However, if the legacy implementation set the [idSyncContainerID](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/id-service/using/id-service-api/configurations/idsyncontainerid.html?lang=en)Â configuration parameter of ID service then that same value should be placed in this text box.
4. Once this value is set and the code deployed, then the 3rd Part ID syncs will fire on the page (for first time, first visitors) just as they did when ID Service was deployed.
