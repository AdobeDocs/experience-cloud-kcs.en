# Adobe Campaign Standard: Can I download a hotclicks report in ACS?

## Description


It has been asked whether or not it is possible to download the out of the box hotclicks report available in Adobe Campaign Standard so it can be shared.


## Resolution


Currently this is not possible and an enhancement (CAMP-49568) has been entered to have this functionality created in a later release.
