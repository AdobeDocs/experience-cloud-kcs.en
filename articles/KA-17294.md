# Is it possible to download a hotclicks report in ACS?

## Description


Is it possible to download the out of the box hotclicks report available in Adobe Campaign Standard so it can be shared?


## Resolution


Currently this is not possible and an enhancement `(CAMP-49568)` has been entered to have this functionality created in a later release.
