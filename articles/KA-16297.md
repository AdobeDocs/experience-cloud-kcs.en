## Resolution


Resolution

Confirm that the Campaign user in AEM has replication rights.  Instructions for doing so can be found here: [https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/administering/security/security.html?lang=en#setting-replication-privileges](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/administering/security/security.html?lang=en#setting-replication-privileges)

Cause

If the Campaign user does not have replication rights, it cannot copy content from AEM.
