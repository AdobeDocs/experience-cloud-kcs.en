## Resolution {#resolution}


Confirm that the Campaign user in AEM has replication rights.  For steps, refer to [Setting Replication Privileges](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/administering/security/security.html?lang=en#setting-replication-privileges) in the Administering Guide.

<b>Cause</b>
If the Campaign user does not have replication rights, it cannot copy content from AEM.
