# Adobe Campaign Standard: Imported File Transfer activities cannot change external account

## Description

It has been reported that in ACS when exporting a workflow that contains a File Transfer activity which is sending to an SFTP site via an External Account that upon import the File Transfer activity inherits this reference to the External Account even though the particular account in question doesn't exist within the new environment.

Additionally, the transfer activity cannot be updated to select a new External Account.

## Resolution

Currently there isn't a resolution, however CAMP-38001 has been opened with R&D to address this with a long term fix.

In the short term, the workaround is to delete the imported File Transfer activity and recreate it.Â  This will allow selection of the external accounts.
