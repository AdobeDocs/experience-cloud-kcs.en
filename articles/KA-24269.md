# Delivery fails with "Replication not confirmed: schema:'nms:delivery'" error


When the delivery preparation process fails in Adobe Campaign Classic with the following error: *Replication not confirmed: schema:'nms:delivery'*, use the *Campaign burst* warehouse if available. Follow the steps mentioned in this article to resolve the issue.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Campaign Classic v8



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Delivery preparation process fails with the following errors:

*XSV-350122 An error occurred and the process has been stopped.*
*SOP-330011 Error while executing the method 'PrepareTargetImpl' of service 'nms:delivery'.*
*Replication not confirmed: schema:'nms:delivery', id(s): 'XXXXXXXX'*


## Resolution {#resolution}

<b>Cause:</b>
Such an error occurs when the delivery replication query on Snowflake takes a long time to execute. This usually happens when multiple workflows/deliveries are running simultaneously.
<b>Solution:</b>
1. Utilize the workflow heatmap to optimize the timing of workflow and delivery processes.


2. Use the *Campaign burst* warehouse if available.


3. If all the above solutions are implemented and the error persists, please raise a ticket with the Adobe Customer Care team to review the Snowflake warehouse sizes.
