# Sync files (or .c2c) are not visible in “Onboarding Status Report” in AAM the user UI


Learn why the user is not able to see C2C files under Onboarding Status Report in Adobe Audience Manager (AAM) user UI.

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

- Adobe Audience Manager

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

The user is not able to see C2C files under Onboarding Status Report in AAM user UI. Learn why.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Please note that the Onboarding Status Report in AAM user UI is designed in such a way that C2C files would not appear in the report. A sync file does not contain onboarded data as such but mainly what can be considered a matching table between two or more sets of identifiers.

In case the user wants to know about the status of the C2C file, then the user needs to reach out to the support team for help in finding the status of the ingestion.
