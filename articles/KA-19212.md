# Sync files (or .c2c) are not visible in “Onboarding Status Report” in AAM Customer UI

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

- Adobe Audience Manager

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

The customer is not able to see C2C files under Onboarding Status Report in AAM Customer UI. Why?


## Resolution {#resolution}


Please note that the Onboarding Status Report in AAM Customer UI is designed in such a way that C2C files would not appear in the report. A sync file does not contain onboarded data as such but mainly what can be considered a matching table between two or more sets of identifiers.

In case the customer wants to know about the status of the C2C file, then the customer needs to reach out to the support team for help in finding the status of the ingestion.
