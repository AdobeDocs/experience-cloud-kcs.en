# Sync files (or .c2c) are not visible in the Onboarding Status Report in AAM


This article explains why you are unable to see .c2c files in the Onboarding Status Report in Adobe Audience Manager (AAM) UI.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Audience Manager (AAM)

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

You are not able to see the .c2c files in the Onboarding Status Report in AAM UI.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Please note that the Onboarding Status Report in AAM user UI is designed in a way that C2C files would not appear in the report. A sync file does not contain onboarded data as such but mainly what can be considered a matching table between two or more sets of identifiers.

If you want to know about the status of the C2C file, reach out to the Support team for help in finding the status of the ingestion.
