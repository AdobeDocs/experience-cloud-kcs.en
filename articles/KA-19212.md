# Audience Manager - Sync files (or .c2c) are not visible in “Onboarding Status Report” in AAM Customer UI - Why?

## Description

<b>Query:</b> The customer is not able to see C2C files under Onboarding Status Report in AAM Customer UI. Why?

## Resolution


<b>Solution: </b>Please note that the “Onboarding Status Report” in AAM Customer UI is designed in this way that C2C files would not be surfaced in the “Onboarding Status Report”. A sync file does not contain onboarded data as such but mainly what can be considered a matching table between tow or more sets of identifiers

In case the Customer wants to know about the status of the C2C file then the Customer needs to reach out to the support team and they help the customer in finding the status of the ingestion.
