# Copying marketing channel configuration from 1 report suite to another

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Customer Journey Analytics
- Analytics



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
What happens when you copy Marketing channel configurations from one report suite to another?


## Resolution


Let's say the *source report suite*from where the marketing channel configuration is to be copied is *A*, and the *destination report suite*is *B<b>*.</b>

1. In *Marketing Channel Manager*, channels from *A*will be copied over to *B*with the *Enabled*check box checked.

2. In *Marketing Channel Manager* for *B*, the *Enabled*checkbox for existing channels will be disabled.

3. *Marketing channel processing rules* from *A*will get copied over to *B*, while the existing marketing channel processing rules in *B*remain as is.

So even though the copy worked, it doesn't delete channels or corresponding rules from the destination, i.e., *B*.
