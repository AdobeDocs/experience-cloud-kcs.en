# Things to remember while copying marketing channel configuration from 1 report suite to another?

## Description


What happens when you copy Marketing channel configurations from one report suite to another?


## Resolution


Let's say the <b>source </b>report suite from where the marketing channel configuration is to be copied is <b>A</b>, and the <b>destination </b>report suite is <b>B.</b>

1. In *Marketing Channel Manager*, channels from A will be copied over to B with *Enabled*check box checked.

2.Â In *Marketing Channel Manager* for B, *Enabled*checkbox for existing channels will get disabled.

3. *Marketing channel processing rules* from A will get copied over to B, while the existing marketing channel processing rules in B remain as is.

So even though the copy worked, it doesn't ever delete channels or corresponding rules from the destination i.e B.
