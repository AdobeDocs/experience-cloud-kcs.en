# Extended field is not accessible from JavaScript code running in MTA


Learn why MTA cannot query newly created columns but when the same script is used in a workflow, it can easily push/pull the data.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Classic

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

You are getting the error *attribute ‘weChatToken’ unknown*when:

- You use WeChat API with a custom connector and have extended the external account schema to add some parameters the WeChat API uses, like a session token column, username, etc.
- When using `queryDef` in a JS activity in a workflow, you can pull data from the new columns. However, when you are using this connector to trigger a delivery, the `queryDef` function isn’t able to find the new columns.


This means when the MTA is running this script, it is not able to query newly created columns. But the same script, when used in a workflow, can pull/push data.

When you query an OOTB column in this connector, you can pull data. The only issue is coming with newly created columns.


## Resolution {#resolution}




Adobe<b> </b>Engineering has confirmed that Campaign is not supporting the functionality of MTA querying new columns using `querydef` function.



An Enhancement request to add this capability to the Campaign was rejected as such functionality could lead to serious concurrency problems between emails, SMS, push, and custom API priorities on MTA.
