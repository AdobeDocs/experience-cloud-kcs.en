## Description


Objective

Environment

## Resolution

Download and install the latest ACS Commons library version via /crx/packmgr/index.jsp.  It can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Adobe-Consulting-Services/acs-aem-commons/releases).

2.  

Go to *http://aemhost:port*/miscadmin and copy the out of the box Dispatcher Flush agent as many times as needed and modify (set with the IP of each dispatcher).

For example:

dispatcher1

General = Enabled

Transport = http://10.43.32.126/dispatcher/invalidate.cache

Triggers = Check these boxes: Ignore Default, No Status Update, No Versioning

dispatcher2

General = Enabled

Transport = http://10.43.32.146/dispatcher/invalidate.cache

Triggers = Check these boxes: Ignore Default, No Status Update, No Versioning

3.  

Configure Dispatcher Flush UI to delete everything in the cache under /etc in the cache folder.  Refer to the [documentation](https://adobe-consulting-services.github.io/acs-aem-commons/features/dispatcher-flush-ui/index.html).
