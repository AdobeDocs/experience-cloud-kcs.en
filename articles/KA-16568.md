1. Download and install the latest *ACS Commons library*version via `/crx/packmgr/index.jsp`. It can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Adobe-Consulting-Services/acs-aem-commons/releases).
2. Go to *http://aemhost:port*/miscadmin and copy the out-of-the-box *Dispatcher Flush agent*as many times as needed and modify (set with the IP of each dispatcher).
    <b>For example:</b>
    


    ```
    dispatcher1
    ```

    
    `General => Enabled`
    `Transport => http://10.43.32.126/dispatcher/invalidate.cache`
    `Triggers => Check these boxes: Ignore Default, No Status Update, No Versioning`
    ` `
    `dispatcher2`
    `General => Enabled`
    `Transport => http://10.43.32.146/dispatcher/invalidate.cache`
    `Triggers => Check these boxes: Ignore Default, No Status Update, No Versioning`
3. Configure *Dispatcher Flush UI*to delete everything in the cache under */etc.*in the cache folder. Refer to the [documentation](https://adobe-consulting-services.github.io/acs-aem-commons/features/dispatcher-flush-ui/index.html).
