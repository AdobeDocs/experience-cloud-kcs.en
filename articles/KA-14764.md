# ACS - Transactional message cannot display more than 3 products (elements of data collection)

## Description


When triggering a transactional message, the API call contains 5 products however only 3 products contained in the email.

The received email does not seem to be able contain more than 3 products even if more than 3 products are present in the call.

The products (elements) are displayed using data collection on the transactional message template (see [https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/campaign-standard/using/administrating/configuring-channels/configuring-transactional-messaging.html#configuring-transactional-messaging_use-case--configuring-an-event-to-send-a-transactional-message](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/campaign-standard/using/administrating/configuring-channels/configuring-transactional-messaging.html#configuring-transactional-messaging_use-case--configuring-an-event-to-send-a-transactional-message))


## Resolution


This issue can be observed if the "data-nl-loop-length" attribute in the source HTML of the template is set to 3. In this case the data collection will not fetch more than 3 elements.

To rectify this, the attribute can be modified directly in the transaction template source HTML.
