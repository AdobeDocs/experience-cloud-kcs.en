# ACS - Transactional message cannot display more than 3 products (elements of data collection)

## Description


<b>Environment</b>

Campaign Standard



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

When triggering a transactional message, the API call contains five products. However, only three products are contained in the email.

The received email does not seem to be able to contain more than three products, even if more than three products are present in the call.

The products (elements) are displayed using data collection on the transactional message template (see [Configuring a transactional event](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-standard/using/communication-channels/transactional-messaging/event-configuration/configuring-transactional-event.html?lang=en)in our developer documentation)


## Resolution


<b>Cause</b>

This issue is observed if the `data-nl-loop-length` attribute in the source HTML of the template is set to 3. In this case, the data collection will not fetch more than three elements.



<b>Solution</b>

Modify the attribute directly in the transaction template source HTML.
