# SegmentNotFoundException seen in Cold Standby logs

## Description


<b>Issue:</b>
 One sees SegmentNotFoundException on Author Cold Standby, like the example traces at 1.

<b>Details:</b>
 The logs that pointing to SegmentNotFoundException on the standby instances only are false positives, and the segment is found later.
 If such logs are only seen in standby, and not when starting the instance as primary, then they can be ignored. 


 1: \*DEBUG\* standby-run-46189 org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.segment.standby.client.StandbyClientSyncExecution Found reference from 451216fa-7d43-4b3a-a262-03abfc3c3fb1 to fbb91bad-9051-4ace-a77b-35fda8a358c6
 org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.segment.SegmentNotFoundException: Segment fbb91bad-9051-4ace-a77b-35fda8a358c6 not found


## Resolution


<b>Steps to be followed:</b>

- If such traces for 'SegmentNotFoundException' are only seen in cold standby logs, and not when starting the instance as primary, then they can be ignored.
- Continue to monitor the standby instances, as explained in 1.
- Also, please note that "org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.plugins.segment.SegmentNotFoundException" (related article at 2) and "org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.segment.SegmentNotFoundException" (related article at 3) are two different exceptions.
- The "org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.segment.SegmentNotFoundException" seen in the standby logs is not the one that needs recovery steps from the article 2.
- Only if we see "org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.plugins.segment.SegmentNotFoundException" after starting standby as primary, we may need perform a recovery process 2.
