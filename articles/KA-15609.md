# SegmentNotFoundException seen in Cold Standby logs


If `SegmentNotFoundException` error occurs in the Author Cold Standby instance in Adobe Experience Manager, the logs on standby instances are false positives. They can be safely ignored if they only appear on standby and not when starting the instance as primary.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Experience Manager



### Issue/Symptoms

The error `SegmentNotFoundException` occurs in Author Cold Standby, similar to this example error:


```
*DEBUG* [ standby-run-46189]  org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.segment.standby.client.StandbyClientSyncExecution Found reference from 451216fa-7d43-4b3a-a262-03abfc3c3fb1 to fbb91bad-9051-4ace-a77b-35fda8a358c6

org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.segment.SegmentNotFoundException: Segment fbb91bad-9051-4ace-a77b-35fda8a358c6 not found
```


<b>Cause</b>
 The logs that point to `SegmentNotFoundException` on the standby instances only are false positives, and the segment is found later.
 If such logs are only seen in standby, and not when starting the instance as primary, then they can be ignored.




## Resolution {#resolution}


When this error occurs, follow these steps:

1. If traces for `SegmentNotFoundException` are only seen in cold standby logs, and not when starting the instance as primary, then they can be ignored.
2. Continue to monitor the standby instances, as explained in [How to Run AEM with TarMK Cold Standby: Monitoring](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-65/deploying/deploying/tarmk-cold-standby.html#monitoring) in AEM Documentation in Adobe Experience League.
3. Also, please note that `org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.plugins.segment.SegmentNotFoundException` (related article [Fix Inconsistencies in the repository when SegmentNotFound Issue is reported in AEM 6.x](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kb/fix-inconsistencies-in-the-repository-when-segmentnotfound-issue.html) in AEM Documentation in Adobe Experience League) and `org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.segment.SegmentNotFoundException` (related article at [Fix Inconsistencies by restarting AEM when SegmentNotFound Issue is reported in AEM 6.3](https://helpx.adobe.com/au/experience-manager/kb/fix-inconsistencies-by-restarting-AEM-when-segmentNotFound-issue-is-reported-in-AEM.html) in the AEM Documentation in Adobe Help Center) are two different exceptions.
4. The `org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.segment.SegmentNotFoundException` seen in the standby logs is not the one that needs recovery steps from the article [Fix Inconsistencies in the repository when SegmentNotFound Issue is reported in AEM 6.x](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kb/fix-inconsistencies-in-the-repository-when-segmentnotfound-issue.html) in AEM Documentation in Adobe Experience League.
5. Only if you see `org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.plugins.segment.SegmentNotFoundException` after starting standby as primary, you may need to perform a recovery process [Fix Inconsistencies in the repository when SegmentNotFound Issue is reported in AEM 6.x](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kb/fix-inconsistencies-in-the-repository-when-segmentnotfound-issue.html) in AEM Documentation in Adobe Experience League.
