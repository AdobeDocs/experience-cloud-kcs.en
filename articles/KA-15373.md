## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Analytics

<b>Issue</b>
 Is there any way you can get “views” data?

You want to check which website element is mostly viewed.


## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Solution</b>

No. Impression tracking use Activity Map would require hundreds of extra tracking calls per page load. Since Adobe Analytics price is based on server calls processed, it is not economical to track impressions with Activity Map.

Some competitors of Activity Map do however offer this feature under certain contract options, but <b>Activity Map</b> is a free add-on that is a one-size-fits-all solution.
