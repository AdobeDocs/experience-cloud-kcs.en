# [!DNL Analytics] Activity Map: View (impression) data on links

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Analytics

<b>Issue</b>
 Can you get "views" data?

You want to check which website element is mostly viewed.


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>

1. No. The reason is that tracking all the links that are viewed on each page load would be extremely costly to collect: each page load, we would need to collect thousands of additional strings, so it would be way too costly for Adobe or our customers.
2. Some of our competitors offer this feature under certain contract options, but <b>Activity Map</b> is a free add-on that is a one-size-fits-all solution.

    Custom pricing for custom collection is not something that we currently offer.
