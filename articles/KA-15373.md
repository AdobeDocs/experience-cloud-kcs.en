# Analytics Activity Map - View (impression) data on links

## Description


Is there any way to get “views” data.  We want to check which website element is mostly viewed.


## Resolution


1. No. The reason is that tracking all the links that are viewed on each page load would be extremely costly to collect: each page load, we would need to collect thousands of additional strings  way too costly for Adobe or our customers.
2. Some of our competitors offer this feature under certain contract options but Activity Map is a free add-on that is a one size fit all solution. As such custom pricing for custom collection is not something that we can offer.
