# Frontend pipeline deployment breaks the website


This article describes a solution to the issue where frontend pipelines are not successfully applied to websites, even when deployment finishes successfully.Â Add ServerAlias to an enabled vhost to fix it.



## Description {#description}


### Environment

AEM as a Cloud Service

### Issue/Symptoms

Frontend pipelines are not successfully applied to websites. Although the deployment finishes successfully, the `js/css` files are not applied to the website.

#### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a new site using the `aem-site-template-standard version 2.2.0`.
2. Download sources from that site.
3. Make some changes to the website theme.
4. Push sources into the repo/branch.
5. Run FE pipeline from that repo/branch.


After the FE pipeline is deployed, the new site breaks and no `js/css` is loaded.

In addition, you will see that at:

`"/conf/fe-pipeline-test/sling:configs/com.adobe.cq.wcm.core.components.config.HtmlPageItemsConfig/jcr:content"`, the property `"prefixPath"` is set to:

`"https://static-pxxxxx-eyyyyy.adobeaemcloud.com/5be94d5dbcc77e833330ed8d9d98f549f85aebfffd0ce933c04f9b1e6e67bdad"`, which looks good.

But whatever resource we try to load from this server (like the `css: https://static-pxxxxx-eyyyyy.adobeaemcloud.com/5be94d5dbcc77e833330ed8d9d98f549f85aebfffd0ce933c04f9b1e6e67bdad/theme.css)`, we always get "<b>It works</b>".


## Resolution {#resolution}


Based on the fact that when styling loads from the static domain, it only returns "<b>It Works</b>", we need to verify whether the static domain is not blocked at the dispatcher level.

For FE pipelines to work, the deployed frontend artifacts need to be served correctly by CDN/dispatcher.

If the static domain is blocked by the dispatcher configuration, the `css/js` cannot be loaded.

For this, at least one of the enabled vhosts has either:

`ServerAlias *`
OR


```
ServerAlias "static-p<progId>-e<envId>.adobeaemcloud.com"
```


`On checking the customer's dispatcher configuration, it could be seen that only the deault.vhost has ServerAlias "*". However, the default.vhost was not enabled.`

`Adding ServerAlias to an enabled vhost fixed the issue.`
