# Frontend pipeline deployment breaks the website


Environment: AEM as a Cloud Service

## Description {#description}


Frontend pipelines are not successfully applied to websites. Although the deployment finishes successfully, the js/css files are not applied to the website.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create a new site using the aem-site-template-standard version 2.2.0
2. Download sources from that site
3. Make some change to the website theme
4. Push sources into repo/branch
5. Run FE pipeline from that repo/branch


However, after the FE pipeline was deployed, the new site was broken, no js/css being loaded.

In additionÂ it can be seen, that at "/conf/fe-pipeline-test/sling:configs/com.adobe.cq.wcm.core.components.config.HtmlPageItemsConfig/jcr:content" the property "prefixPath" is set to "https://static-pxxxxx-eyyyyy.adobeaemcloud.com/5be94d5dbcc77e833330ed8d9d98f549f85aebfffd0ce933c04f9b1e6e67bdad", which looks good. But whatever resource we try to load from this server (like the css: https://static-pxxxxx-eyyyyy.adobeaemcloud.com/5be94d5dbcc77e833330ed8d9d98f549f85aebfffd0ce933c04f9b1e6e67bdad/theme.css), we always get a "<b>It work's</b>"


## Resolution {#resolution}


Based on the fact that when the styling is loaded from the static domain only returns 'It Works", we need to verify whether the static domain is not blocked at the dispatcher level.

For FE pipelines to work, the deployed frontend artifacts need to be served correctly by CDN/dispatcher.
If the static domain is blocked by the dispatcher configuration, the css/js cannot be loaded.

For this, at least one of the enabled vhosts has either:

ServerAlias \*
or
ServerAlias "static-p`<` progId`>` -e`<` envId`>` .adobeaemcloud.com"

Checking the customer's dispatcher configuration, it could be seen that only the deault.vhost has ServerAlias "\*". However, the default.vhost was not enabled.

Adding ServerAlias to an enabled vhost fixed the issue.
