# Source fields are not auto mapped

## Description

While mapping source fields to target schema, a few source fields are not getting populated automatically.
<br>Some of the fields need to be mapped manually.

## Resolution


In general, AEP tries to do the best guess to automatically map fields, but its not guaranteed that it will work for all fields. Even if it is mapped automatically, its recommended to check and adjust (if required) mapped fields manually.
