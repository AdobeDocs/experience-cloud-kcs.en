# Source fields are not auto mapped


Learn what happens whenÂ source fields are not being populated automatically.

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Platform

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

While mapping source fields to target schema, a few source fields are not being populated automatically. As a result, some of the fields need to be mapped manually.


## Resolution {#resolution}


In general, AEP tries to do the best guess to automatically map fields, but its not guaranteed that it will work for all fields.

Even if it is mapped automatically, it is recommended to check and adjust (if required) mapped fields manually.
