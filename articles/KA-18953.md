Account type can be of following types: INVITE_ADVERTISER , INVITE_PARTNER,  DFP,  ADX,  ADX_PUBLISHER ,       DFP_BY_GOOGLE, DFP_BY_GOOGLE. Also please note, This type should be Whitelisted at Google's end. (Client can check with Google's Team for this part).
2. Once we have this detail, CC or Consultant can create the destination.
