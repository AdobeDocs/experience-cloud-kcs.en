How to add a property “StrictHostCheck” at the Dispatcher configuration in AEMaaCS ?


## Resolution {#resolution}


The https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/mod/core.html#stricthostcheck is not on allow list of validator for cloud dispatcher as part of AEMaaCS.
It might be valid for "normal" Apache HTTPD based sites, but Host / X-Forwarded-Host handling is done in AEM CS by design this way.

It's due to how Apache HTTPD is configured in AEM CS - if given hostname is not matched by the customer virtual hosts, the request goes to dummy "sink" catch-all vhost `[` 1`]`
