# How to add stricthostcheck in AEMaaCS dispatcher configuration


This article explains how to add `stricthostcheck` as per `[` 1`]`  in AEMaaCS dispatcher configuration.

`[` 1`]`  https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/mod/core.html#stricthostcheck

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service (AEMaaCS)

### Issue/Symptoms

How to add the property “`StrictHostCheck`” at the Dispatcher configuration in AEMaaCS?


## Resolution {#resolution}


[Stricthostcheck](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/mod/core.html#stricthostcheck) is not on the allow list of validators for cloud dispatcher as part of AEMaaCS.

It might be valid for "normal" Apache HTTPD based sites, but Host / X-Forwarded-Host handling is done in AEMaaCS by design this way.

It's due to how Apache HTTPD is configured in AEMaaCS - if given hostname is not matched by the customer virtual hosts, the request goes to dummy "sink" [catch-all vhost](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype/blob/develop/src/main/archetype/dispatcher.cloud/src/conf.d/dispatcher_vhost.conf#L277-L307) on purpose.
