# What is the character limit for Environment Variables in Cloud Manager?


This article provides details on the maximum character limits imposed on environment variables within Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service's Cloud Manager for different environments such as staging, production, and development.

## Description {#description}


When configuring environment variables in Cloud Manager, it is essential to understand the constraints regarding the length of these variables. This knowledge is crucial for developers and administrators when setting up and managing environment configurations for AEM as a Cloud Service.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The character length for environment variables, which can be set for each specific environment (stage, prod, dev) in Cloud Manager, should not exceed 2048 characters. This limit ensures that the variables can be processed efficiently and aligns with best practices for configuration management within AEM as a Cloud Service.
