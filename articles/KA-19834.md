# Upsert forbidden error while editing AEP segments in AAM


Learn how to resolve the Adobe Audience Manager issue where there were errors trying to save an Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) segment in Adobe Audience Manager (AAM).

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

- Adobe Audience Manager

- Adobe Experience Platform

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

While mapping/editing an AEP segment in AAM, the following errors occur:

`There were errors trying to save the segment.`


```
Policy enforcement service error: UPSERT forbidden. Upsert will result in parent dangling reference.
```



## Resolution {#resolution}


This could happen at the time of enablement from AEP to AAM connector when the backfill is going on, but that has a very short window.

Retrying after a gap of 5-10 minutes usually results in a successful action.
