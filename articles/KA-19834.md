# Upsert forbidden error while editing AEP segments in AAM

## Description

<br>While mapping/editing an AEP segment in AAM, the following error occurs:<br><br>Â <br><br>There were errors, trying to save the segment.<br><br>Policy enforcement service error: UPSERT forbidden. Upsert will result in parent dangling reference.<br>

## Resolution


This could happen at the time of enablement from AEP to AAM connector when backfill is going on but that has a very short window.

Retrying after some 5-10 minutes gap usually result in successful action.
