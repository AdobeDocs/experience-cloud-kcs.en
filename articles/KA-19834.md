# Upsert forbidden error while editing AEP segments in AAM

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

- Adobe Audience Manager

- Adobe Experience Platform

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

While mapping/editing an AEP segment in AAM, the following errors occur:


```
There were errors trying to save the segment.
Policy enforcement service error: UPSERT forbidden. Upsert will result in parent dangling reference.
```



## Resolution {#resolution}


This could happen at the time of enablement from AEP to AAM connector when backfill is going on, but that has a very short window.

Retrying after a gap of 5-10 minutes usually results in successful action.
