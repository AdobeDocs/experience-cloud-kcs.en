# Installing SFTP/SSH Server on Windows using OpenSSH

## Description


Purpose of this document to enable Support Team or the Consultant to be able to Install sftp/ssh server on their local machine.

This document is for those who are working over Windows Machine. For MAC the article will be published shortly.


## Resolution


<b>Installing SFTP/SSH Server:</b>

<b>On Windows 10:</b>

- In the <b>*Settings</b>* app, go to <b>*Apps  Apps & features  Manage optional features</b>*.
- Locate the <b>*“OpenSSH server”</b>* feature, expand it, and select <b>*Install</b>*.


Binaries are installed to <b>%WINDIR%\System32\OpenSSH</b>. Configuration file (sshd_config) and host keys are installed <b>to %ProgramData%\ssh</b> (only after the server is started for the first time).

You may still want to use the following manual installation to install a newer version of OpenSSH than the one built into Windows 10.

<b>On earlier versions of Windows:</b>

- Download the latest [OpenSSH for Windows binaries](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/releases "https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/releases") (package OpenSSH-Win64.zip or OpenSSH-Win32.zip)
- As the Administrator, extract the package to C:\Program Files\OpenSSH
- As the Administrator, install *sshd* and *ssh-agent* services:


powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install-sshd.ps1



<b>Configuring SSH server</b>

Top of Form

Bottom of Form

- Allow incoming connections to SSH server in Windows Firewall:

    - Either run the following PowerShell command (Windows 8 and 2012 or newer only) as the Administrator:


New-NetFirewallRule -Name sshd -DisplayName 'OpenSSH SSH Server' -Enabled True -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -LocalPort 22

- - or go to *Control Panel  System and Security  Windows Firewall*[1](https://winscp.net/eng/docs/guide_windows_openssh_server#fn1)*Advanced Settings  Inbound Rules* and add a new rule for port 22.
- Start the service and configure automatic start:

    - Go to *Control Panel  System and Security  Administrative Tools* and open *Services*. Locate *OpenSSH SSH Server* service.
    - If you want the server to start automatically when your machine is started: Go to *Action  Properties*. In the Properties dialog, change the *Startup type* to *Automatic* and confirm.
    - Start the *OpenSSH SSH Server* service by clicking the *Start the service*.


NOTE: You can refer to this video tutorial for enabling and executing the OpenSSH server: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G1Qh-_jBTQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G1Qh-_jBTQ)



<b>Setting up SSH public key authentication</b>
<br><br> <br><br>
Follow a generic guide for [Setting up SSH public key authentication](https://winscp.net/eng/docs/guide_public_key) in \*nix OpenSSH server, with the following difference:

- Create the `.ssh` folder (for the `authorized_keys` file) in your Windows account profile folder (typically in `C:\Users\username\.ssh`).
- For permissions to the `.ssh` folder and `authorized_keys` file, what matters are Windows ACL permissions, not simple \*nix permissions. Set the ACL so that only a respective Windows account has to write access to the folder and the file (what is the default access level if you create the folder and the file while logged in using the respective account).


<b>Connecting to the server</b>
<br><br> <br><br><b>Finding Host Key</b>
Before the first connection, find out the fingerprint of the server’s host key by using `ssh-keygen.exe` for each file.

<b>In Windows command-prompt, use: </b>


```
for %f in (%ProgramData%\ssh\ssh_host_*_key) do @%WINDIR%\System32\OpenSSH\ssh-keygen.exe -l -f "%f"
```


*Replace*`%WINDIR%\System32`*with*`%ProgramFiles%`*, if appropriate.*

<b>In PowerShell, use: </b>


```
Get-ChildItem $env:ProgramData\ssh\ssh_host_*_key | ForEach-Object { . $env:WINDIR\System32\OpenSSH\ssh-keygen.exe -l -f $_ }
```


*Replace*`$env:WINDIR\System32`*with*`$env:ProgramFiles`*, if appropriate.*

You will get an output like this:


```
C:\Windows\System32\OpenSSHfor %f in (%ProgramData%\ssh\ssh_host_*_key) do @%WINDIR%\System32\OpenSSH\ssh-keygen.exe -l -f "%f"
```

<b>Connecting</b>
<br><br> <br><br>
Start WinSCP. [A login dialog](https://winscp.net/eng/docs/ui_login) will appear. On the dialog:

- Make sure the *New site* node is selected.
- On the *New site node*, ensure the *SFTP* protocol is selected.
- Enter your machine/server IP address (or a hostname) into the *Hostname* box.
- Enter your Windows account name into the *User name* box. If running on a domain, it might have to be entered in the format user@domain.
- For a public key authentication:

    - Press the *Advanced* button to open the [Advanced site settings dialog](https://winscp.net/eng/docs/ui_login_advanced) and go to *[SSH  Authentication page](https://winscp.net/eng/docs/ui_login_authentication)*.
    - In the *Private key file,* the box selects your private key file.
    - Submit the Advanced site settings dialog with the *OK* button.
- For a password authentication:

    - Enter your Windows account password into the *Password* box.
    - If your Windows account does not have a password, you cannot authenticate with the password authentication (i.e., with an empty password); you need to use the public key authentication.
- Save your site settings using the *Save* button.
- Login using the *Login* button.
- [Verify the host key](https://winscp.net/eng/docs/ssh_verifying_the_host_key) by comparing fingerprints with those collected before (see above).
