# AEM: Changes in GraphQL handling of null values


The first change affects filter conditions leveraging the `CONTAINS_NOT` operator, the other two concern *null* values in filter conditions on multi-values fields.

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) as a Cloud Service

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
 In the release 2023.02.11382, some improvements have been made in the GraphQL (Open-Source Query Language) implementation that might cause unexpected behavior in the application code, in case when it relied on the erroneous behavior of the older releases. The below mentioned resolution helps achieve that Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) GraphQL now returns content with null values consistently across all filter operations.




## Resolution {#resolution}

<b>`CONTAINS_NOT` and *null* values</b><br> <br>The first change affects filter conditions leveraging the `CONTAINS_NOT` operator. In previous releases, this `CONTAINS_NOT` did not return content fragments containing *null* values in the field to which the filter condition was applied. This is inconsistent with similar operators like `EQUALS_NOT` or `NOT_AT`.<br>Please ensure your client application is able to handle *null* values that are returned by AEM when using `CONTAINS_NOT`.<br> <br><b>Example:</b>

| <b>Filter fragment</b> | <b>Data</b> | <b>Result before 2023.02.11382</b> | <b>Result starting with 2023.02.11382</b> |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| myField: {<br>    value: "frag", <br>    _op: CONTAINS_NOT<br>} | `[` <br>    {<br>        myField: null<br>    }, <br>    {<br>        myField: "Some text"<br>    },<br>    {<br>        myField: "Text fragment"<br>    }<br>`]`  | `[` <br>    {<br>        myField: "Some text"<br>    }<br>`]`  | `[` <br>    {<br>        myField: null<br>    },<br>    {<br>        myField: "Some text"<br>    }<br>`]`  |

<b>Apply modes `ALL_OR_EMPTY/ALL` and *null* values</b>
Another issue that was fixed in 2023.02.11382 is related to *null* values in filter conditions on multi-values fields. Apply mode `ALL_OR_EMPTY` (on arrays/multi-value fields) didn't return fragments with *null* values for the field in question, therefore it was actually working as you would expect it for the `ALL` apply method. At the same time, filtering a multi-value field with apply mode `ALL` would include fragments with empty content for that field, but it shouldn't. It is recommended to test the queries that use one of these apply modes and change them if they don't return the expected result set in 2023.02.11382 anymore.

Note that the problem only existed for some operators (pre 2023.02.11382).
For example: `EQUALS_NOT` worked as expected for apply method `ALL_OR_EMPTY`, whereas `CONTAINS` did not.
<b>Example:</b>

| <b>Filter fragment</b> | <b>Data</b> | <b>Result before 2023.02.11382</b> | <b>Result starting with 2023.02.11382</b> |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| myArray: {<br>  _expressions: {<br>    value: "1.3"<br>    _operator: EQUALS_NOT<br>    _apply: ALL<br>  }<br>} | `[` <br>  {<br>    myArray: null<br>  },<br>  {<br>    myArray: `[`  "1.1", "1.2", "1.3" `]` <br>  },<br>  {<br>    myArray: `[`  "2.1", "2.2", "2.3" `]` <br>  }<br>`]`  | `[` <br>  {<br>    myArray: null<br>  },<br>  {<br>    myArray: `[`  "2.1", "2.2", "2.3" `]` <br>  }<br>`]`  | `[` <br>  {<br>    myArray: `[`  "2.1", "2.2", "2.3" `]` <br>  }<br>`]`  |
| myArray: {<br>  _expressions: {<br>    value: "2."<br>    _operator: CONTAINS<br>    _apply: ALL_OR_EMPTY<br>  }<br>} | `[` <br>  {<br>    myArray: `[`  "2.1", "2.2", "2.3" `]` <br>  }<br>`]`  | `[` <br>  {<br>    myArray: null<br>  },<br>  {<br>    myArray: `[`  "2.1", "2.2", "2.3" `]` <br>  }<br>`]`  |

<b>Apply modes: `INSTANCES`, `_instances: 0` and *null* values</b>
The last issue is also related to *null* values in filter conditions on multi-value fields. Apply mode `INSTANCES` with`_instances: 0` didn't match the content fragments that contain *null* values in the respective field before 2023.02.11382, but it will be starting with 2023.02.11382.
It is recommended to test the queries that use this constellation and change them if they don't return the expected result set in 2023.02.11382 anymore.
<b>Example:</b>

| <b>Filter fragment</b> | <b>Data</b> | <b>Result before 2023.02.11382</b> | <b>Result starting with 2023.02.11382</b> |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| myArray: {<br>  _expressions: {<br>    value: "2."<br>    _operator: CONTAINS<br>    _apply: INSTANCES<br>    _instances: 0<br>  }<br>} | `[` <br>  {<br>    myArray: null<br>  },<br>  {<br>    myArray: `[`  "1.1", "1.2", "1.3" `]` <br>  },<br>  {<br>    myArray: `[`  "2.1", "2.2", "2.3" `]` <br>  }<br>`]`  | `[` <br>  {<br>    myArray: `[`  "1.1", "1.2", "1.3" `]` <br>  }<br>`]`  | `[` <br>  {<br>    myArray: null<br>  },<br>  {<br>    myArray: `[`  "1.1", "1.2", "1.3" `]` <br>  }<br>`]`  |

<b>Improvements that may affect customers with `ft-sites-97` enabled</b>
Customers who had the `ft-sites-97`*(GraphQL pagination & optimized filtering)* feature flag enabled *before*release 2023.02.11382 might experience one or more of the following changes in behavior after upgrading to 2023.02.11382.
Customers that don't have this feature flag enabled, are not affected by this section.
<b>null handling with conditions that check for non-equality</b>
Fragment fields with *null* values were intermittently not matched by the filters that were checking for non-equality.

If your code relies on these fragments not being returned, you will have to adjust your code to accommodate for the expected behavior.


| <b>Filter fragment</b> | <b>Data</b> | <b>Result from intermediate implementation</b> | <b>Result from final implementation</b> |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| myField: {<br>  value: "Some text",<br>  _op: EQUALS_NOT<br>} | `[` <br>  {<br>    myField: null<br>  },<br>  {<br>    myField: "Some text"<br>  },<br>  {<br>    myField: "Text fragment"<br>  }<br>`]`  | `[` <br>  {<br>    myField: "Some text"<br>  }<br>`]`  | `[` <br>  {<br>    myField: null<br>  },<br>  {<br>    myField: "Some text"<br>  }<br>`]`  |

<b>Filter operator `NOT_AT` with date/time values</b>
Filter operator `NOT_AT` was intermittently not working correctly with data/times values. Instead, it was working more like the `AFTER` condition. 
If your code relies on the incorrect behavior, you should switch the filter condition to `AFTER`.
<b>Arrays: `INSTANCES` with `_instances: 0` not working correctly</b>
Filter condition `INSTANCES` (on arrays/multivalue fields) with `_instances` set to 0 intermittently didn't work as expected, it didn't return anything where is actually should have.

Filter fragments affected by this issue would look like: `doubleArray: { _expressions: { value: 0, _operator: GREATER, _apply: INSTANCES, _instances: 0 } }`

If you were relying on the erroneous behavior, you need to rewrite your query to return the same results as before.


| <b>Filter fragment</b> | <b>Data</b> | <b>Result from intermediate implementation</b> | <b>Result from final implementation</b> |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| myArray: {<br>  _expressions: {<br>    value: 20<br>    _operator: EQUAL<br>    _apply: INSTANCES<br>    _instances: 0<br>  }<br>} | `[` <br>  {<br>    myArray: null<br>  },<br>  {<br>    myArray: `[`  10, 20, 30 `]` <br>  },<br>  {<br>    myArray: `[`  11, 12, 13 `]` <br>  }<br>`]`  | `[`  `]`  | `[` <br>  {<br>    myArray: null<br>  },<br>  {<br>    myArray: `[`  11, 12, 13 `]` <br>  }<br>`]`  |
