# Target - Redirection Offer-Adobe Target

## Description


In redirection activity, users who are landing on [https://www.xyz.com](https://www.xyz.com), I want to redirect them toÂ [https://www.xyz.com/](https://www.xyz.com/)abc/#/auth URL.

If i am using the "redirect to URL" option in direct, it is not accepting the redirection URL because it has Hash Fragment. How to solve this problem.


## Resolution


To solve this, use a custom code option as:



// Simulate a mouse click:

script

window.location.href = "abc/#/auth";

/script

script



// Simulate an HTTP redirect:

window.location.replace("abc/#/auth");

/script
