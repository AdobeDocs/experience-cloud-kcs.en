# Control vs Targeted Dimension in Analytics

## Description


Having A4T integration established, we can see the data for dimensions such as "Target Activities", "Target Experiences" etc. in the workspace but we could not see any data for the "Control vs Targeted" dimension.Â 

 So we would like to know about what kind of data it captures and the reason why we are not seeing any data for this customer.


## Resolution


Control vs targeted dimension on Analytics is for Automated Personalization/Auto Target activities where there is a percentage of random traffic - control, and remaining is targeted traffic - based on algorithm
