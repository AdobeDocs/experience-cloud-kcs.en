# Viewer Presets cannot be edited

## Description {#description}


<b>Description</b> : Viewer presets are listed correctly on my AEMaaCS instance
However, when I select any viewer preset and click on edit then the preset editing page loads indefinitely.
There is a correct dynamic media configuration under /conf/global/settings/cloudconfigs/dmscene7
What is missing to get the viewer presets editor to work correctly?


## Resolution {#resolution}


Something went wrong with the initial DM setup. In order to correct, you would need to re-run the DM Setup Async job.
 You would login as admin to the AEMaaCS instance, and then open up the
 following path:
 /libs/dam/gui/content/s7dam/samplemanager/samplemanager.html
 This opens up a page with 9 buttons. The 7th is called "Trigger DM Setup
 Async Job". This is the one I ran on the instance that now works.
 It triggeres a job that re-syncs all artwork/css files to DMS7. It can
 take a few minutes to complete. After it has finished, logout, and login
 again, and the viewer presets should be editable.
