# Viewer Presets cannot be edited

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
Dynamic Media Classic


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
Viewer presets are listed correctly on my AEMaaCS instance.
 However, when selecting any viewer preset and clicking on edit then the preset editing page loads indefinitely.
 There is a correct dynamic media configuration under `/conf/global/settings/cloudconfigs/dmscene7`.

What is missing to get the viewer presets editor to work correctly?


## Resolution {#resolution}


Something went wrong with the initial DM setup. In order to correct this, you need to re-run the *DM Setup Async*job.

1. Log in as admin to the AEMaaCS instance, and then open up the following path: `/libs/dam/gui/content/s7dam/samplemanager/samplemanager.html`
2. This opens up a page with nine buttons. The seventh is called *Trigger DM Setup Async Job*. This is the one that now works.
3. It triggers a job that re-syncs all `artwork/css` files to *DMS7*. It can take a few minutes to complete. After it has finished, log out, and log in again, and the viewer presets should be editable.
