# Will removing support for TLS v1.0 and v1.1 impact sending emails to MX servers using these TLS versions?

## Description


Will removing support for TLS v1.0 and v1.1 impact sending emails to MX servers using these TLS versions?


## Resolution


No. These TLS versions are involved with the HTTPS connections into the instance (console connections and API calls for example). There are no changes to the SMTP over TLS configuration (email sending).
