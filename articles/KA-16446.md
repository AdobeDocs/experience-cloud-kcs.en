# How to block IP addresses at the Apache HTTP Server level


Most Web Application Firewalls (WAF) can block lists of IP addresses. However, if you are running Apache HTTP Server and would like to block IPs immediately, follow the steps in the article to make an access list or use Apache's `Require` feature.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)

### Issue

When your site is experiencing a denial of service (DoS) attack, spam, or getting hacked, how do you block IP addresses at the Apache HTTP Server (AEM Dispatcher) level?


## Resolution {#resolution}


### Solution

Most Web Application Firewalls (WAF), such as mod security, can block lists of IP addresses.

However, if you are running Apache HTTP Server and would like to block IPs immediately, follow these steps:

1. Create a file named `block-offending-ips.conf` on your server.
2. Open the file in an editor and add a Location directive that blocks all offending IPs from accessing whatever URLs you want to block.  There are two options for the contents of the file below:

    1. If the request is proxied (via CDN, Load Balancer, etc.) and the remote user's IP is only in a Header such as `X-Forwarded-For` then this configuration can be used.  Note that this configuration doesn't apply if the `remoteip_module` is configured. 

        ```
        <LocationMatch "/.*">
        Order Allow,Deny
        Allow from all
        SetEnvif X-Forwarded-For "10\.42\.137\.123" DenyAccess
        SetEnvif X-Forwarded-For "122\.6\.218\.101" DenyAccess
        #Repeat the "SetEnvlf X-Forwarded-For ..." for each IP you want to block
        Deny from env=DenyAccess
        </LocationMatch>
        ```


    2. Alternatively, if the remote user is directly accessing Apache or you are using remoteip_module (see `[` 1`]` ) to extract and set it within Apache then you can use `mod_authz_core`'s <b>Require</b> feature directly (Apache 2.4):

        ```
        <LocationMatch "/.*">
        <RequireAll>
        Require all granted
        Require not ip 10.42.137.123
        Require not ip 122.6.218.101
        #Repeat the "Require not ip ..." for each IP you want to block
        </RequireAll>
        ></LocationMatch><
        ```



        `[ 1]`
 <br>

        ```
        # Extract true client IP from header added by load balancer/CDN
        <IfModule remoteip_module>
            # valid for ELB or ELB+CloudFront
            RemoteIPHeader X-Forwarded-For
        </IfModule>
        ```


3. Drop the file `block-offending-ips.conf` in `/etc/conf.d` folder of the Apache Web server.
4. Restart the Apache HTTP Server.
