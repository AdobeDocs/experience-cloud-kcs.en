# How to block IP addresses at the Apache HTTP Server level?

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Experience Manager

<b>Issue</b>
 When your site is experiencing a denial of service (DoS) attack, spam, or getting hacked, how do you block IP addresses at the Apache HTTP Server (AEM Dispatcher) level?


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>
Most Web Application Firewalls (WAF), such as mod security, can block lists of IP addresses.
However, if you are running Apache HTTP Server and would like to block IP's immediately, follow these steps:

1. Create a file named `block-offending-ips.conf` on your server.
2. Open the file in an editor and add a Location directive that blocks all offending IP's from accessing whatever URLs you want to block.  There are two options for the contents of the file below:
    1. If the request is proxied (via CDN, Load Balancer, etc.) and the remote user's IP is only in a Header such as `X-Forwarded-For` then this configuration can be used.  Note that this configuration doesn't apply if the `remoteip_module` is configured.  <br>

        ```
        LocationMatch "/.*"
        Order Allow,Deny
        Allow from all
        SetEnvif X-Forwarded-For "10\.42\.137\.123" DenyAccess
        SetEnvif X-Forwarded-For "122\.6\.218\.101" DenyAccess
        #Repeat the "SetEnvlf X-Forwarded-For ..." for each IP you want to block
        Deny from env=DenyAccess
        /LocationMatch
        ```
    2. Alternatively, if the remote user is directly accessing Apache or you are using remoteip_module (see 1) to extract and set it within Apache then you can use `mod_authz_core`'s <b>Require</b> feature directly (Apache 2.4):

        ```
        LocationMatch "/.*"
        RequireAll
        Require all granted
        Require not ip 10.42.137.123
        Require not ip 122.6.218.101
        #Repeat the "Require not ip ..." for each IP you want to block
        /RequireAll
        /LocationMatch
        ```

        `1`


        ```
        # Extract true client IP from header added by load balancer/CDN
        IfModule remoteip_module
            # valid for ELB or ELB+CloudFront
            RemoteIPHeader X-Forwarded-For
        /IfModule
        ```
3. Drop the file `block-offending-ips.conf` in `/etc/conf.d` folder of the Apache Web server.
4. Restart the Apache HTTP Server.
