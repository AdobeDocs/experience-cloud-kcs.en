# Adobe Campaign Classic: Disabling FDA connection for Oracle DB will still allows access to external tables

## Description


It has been reported that when disabling an FDA connection by deselecting the check box users still have access to run campaigns or workflows against the tables within the disabled external account. Additionally, removing the username and password from the account does not work as the values are cached.






## Resolution


The permanent fix will soon be available in the upcoming 7.3.1 June 2022 release based on NEO-39265 and will require an update. A workaround in the interim is to delete the FDA schemas and external account on the Campaign side.
