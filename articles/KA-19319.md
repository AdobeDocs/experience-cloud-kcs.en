# Adobe Campaign Classic: Disabling FDA connection for Oracle DB still allows access to external tables

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

- Adobe Campaign Classic

- Adobe Campaign Classic v7

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

It has been reported that even after disabling an FDA connection by deselecting the check box, users still have access to run campaigns or workflows against the tables within the disabled external account. Additionally, removing the username and password from the account does not work as the values are cached.






## Resolution {#resolution}


The permanent fix will require an update and willÂ soon be available in the upcoming 7.3.1 June 2022 release based on NEO-39265. A workaround in the interim is to delete the FDA schemas and external account on the Campaign side.
