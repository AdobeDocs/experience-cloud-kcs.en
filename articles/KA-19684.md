# Is there a Pinterest destination for AAM?

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Audience Manager

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

How does one setup an Adobe Audience Manager (AAM) destination for Pinterest?


## Resolution {#resolution}


The only option for a Pinterest destination for AAM is using a URL-based destination. Details can be found on this [Experience League Community page](https://experienceleaguecommunities.adobe.com/t5/adobe-audience-manager-questions/pinterest-destination/td-p/434687). While not officially supported by Adobe, URL destinations in general are.

Note that the article mentions the possibility of a server-to-server integration (S2S) or a cookie-based destination. Neither of these options were viable when this article was written. There is also no active development of an AAM and Pinterest integration. Customers are encouraged to use a custom URL destination as described earlier.
