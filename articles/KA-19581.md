# Deleting smart tags for multiple assets


Learn how to delete smart tags for multiple assets only at the folder level:

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Experience Manager

<b>Issue</b>
 Can numerous assets be selected and deleted along with their smart tags in Adobe Experience Manager, just as one can select many assets and bulk tag them?


## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Solution</b>

At the moment there is no capability that allows deleting smart tags in bulk.

Smart tags can be bulk managed only at the folder level:

Select the folder `>`  <b>Manage Tags </b>and then you can add or remove tags by navigating the assets in the folder one by one.

Bulk smart tags deletion is suggested to the engineering team to be implemented in future releases.
