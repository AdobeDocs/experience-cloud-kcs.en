# Feature request: Add Next functionality in Asset Share Link detailed view

## Description {#description}


<b>Description</b> :

When sending an Asset Share Link, the user clicks on one asset to enter the detailed view.

When multiple assets are in Share Asset Link, when pressing on one asset to view it, the customer needs to go back to Parent Folder to see the next asset.

The requirement is to add Next functionality to display the next asset in order to avoid going back to parent each time they need to see the next asset.
