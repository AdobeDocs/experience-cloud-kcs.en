# Feature request: Add Next functionality in Asset Share Link detailed view

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

 When sending an Asset Share Link, the user clicks on one asset to enter the detailed view.

When multiple assets are in Share Asset Link, the customer needs to go back to the parent folder to see the next asset.

The requirement is to add <b>Next</b> functionality to display the next asset in order to avoid going back to parent each time they need to see the next asset.
