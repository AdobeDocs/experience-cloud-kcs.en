# Workflow repeats hundreds of times on asset uploading | AEM


To resolve this issue, you can either add the `delete` permission on asset folders for the user, or you can change the properties of 
`/libs/dam/gui/content/assets/jcr:content/body/assetscontent/header/items/default/items/fileupload`.

## Description {#description}


<b>Issue </b>
 Uploading mp4 files in <b>Assets</b> console by drag & drop, the workflows for each mp4 files repeated hundreds of times for hours.
 For example, the workflows of <b>DAM Update Asset</b> for one mp4 repeated 890 times. Every 5 seconds after a workflow instance ended, and a new workflow instance began.

This issue generated error messages similar to below:


```
15.01.2018 10:40:06.628 *ERROR* [ XX.XXX.XX.XX [ 1586753090032]  POST /content/dam/path/to/file.createasset.html HTTP/1.1]  com.day.XX.XXX.core.impl.servlet.CreateAssetServlet Error while creating new asset: Unable to commit changes to session.

```


<br>Another reported symptom is a red blinking onscreen during the asset upload.

<b>Environment</b>
<br>Adobe Experience Manager 6.1 SP1 (AEM 6.1 SP1)

<b>Cause </b>
<br>When trying to upload the asset, the user doesn't have the `delete` permission on the folder.

<br>As a result, when the user uploads a large file (5 MB+), AEM uploads the file dividing it into multiple chunks which are stored under asset node.
<br>Once all chunks are uploaded, AEM consolidates the chunks as the original file, starts DAM Update Asset workflow, and clears the chunks.
<br>But when the user doesn't have the `delete` permission, clearing the chunks fails and as a consequence, file upload restarts again.

## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Resolutions</b>
There are two ways to resolve this issue:<b> </b>

<b>Resolution Method 1</b>
Add the `delete` permission on asset folders for the user.

<b>Resolution Method 2</b>
Change the properties of:
`/libs/dam/gui/content/assets/jcr:content/body/assetscontent/header/items/default/items/fileupload`

To increase the minimum bytes of chunk upload, increase `chunkUploadMinFileSize`.
To disable chunk upload, set false to `chunkUploadSupported`.
