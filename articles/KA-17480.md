# How to unlock a locked page | AEM


A locked page can be unlocked only from the Admin account. No other user has the permission to unlock a page in AEM.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

A page is locked either manually or programmatically. Only you or the object that put the lock on the page can break the lock.

However, if you are not available or the object forgets to unlock the page, is there another way to break the lock?


## Resolution {#resolution}


The `admin`Â account can unlock any page by opening the page and clicking on <b>Unlock Page</b> from the <b>Page Properties</b> drop down.

<b>NOTE</b>: The original user holding the lock does have permission to unlock the page. However, other users, even a member of the administrators' group, DO NOT have the right to unlock pages that have been locked. Only the `admin` account has this right.
