# Trouble Shoot: A4T | [!DNL Target] activities not show up in [!DNL Analytics] workspace

## Description

The content of [!DNL Target] activity is delivered on the page, but data does not display on [!DNL Analytics] report.

   1. Check the Report Suite in Activity's reporting settings.

   1. Check the report suite of test page via browser network by "`/b/ss/`" filter.

   1. If the report suite of [!DNL Target] report settings is different from that used in the test page, then change it. If no, then move on to 2.

1. Confirm the data stitching between [!DNL Target] and [!DNL Analytics].

   1. In the test page, open browser network tab.

   1. Check the `mboxMCSDID` parameter of [!DNL Target] request via filter "`tt.omtrdc.net`"

   1. Check the `sdid` parameter of [!DNL Analytics] request via filter "`/b/ss/`"

   1. If the value of `mboxMCSDID` is different from the vaule of `sdid`, then check the order of execution of [!DNL Target] and [!DNL Analytics] call. [!DNL Target] call should always be executed before [!DNL Analytics].
