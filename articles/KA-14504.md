# Display activity only once

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Target

<b>Issue</b>
 You normally use Adobe Target to launch a popup on a webpage for one day only to notify users of website congestion/maintenance.

However, you want the popup to display only once to all audiences (so it's not annoying/spammy).

You want to look at defining this through creating a custom audience, but can't find any out-of-the-box parameters.


## Resolution


<b>Solutions</b>
The solution depends on your setup with Adobe Target.

<b>Solution 1</b>
If you are not using A4T, you could go into the [!UICONTROL Advanced Settings] in the success metric and choose the option that increments the count and then bars from re-entry. In order for it to work properly, you would have to convert right away, like on user seeing "any mbox".

<b>Solution 2</b>
Or if you have full control over the mbox call (ability to add mbox parameters to it) then you could add a unique mbox parameter such as <b>`isPopup=true`</b>, and then create an profile script which looks for that parameter and then sets a user variable, i.e., `user.hasSeenPopUp`.

<b>Solution 3</b>
The same idea could work if the popup had a had a unique mbox name.
You would then create an audience where `user.hasSeenPopup` does not exist or does not contain true and place that audience on the activity.
