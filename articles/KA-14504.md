# Display activity only once

## Description


We are using Adobe Target to launch a popup on a webpage for one day only to notify them of website congestion/maintenance.

We want the popup to display only once to all audiences (so it's not annoying/spammy).



Looking at defining this through creating a custom audience, but can't find any out of the box parameters.


## Resolution


The solution depends on your setup with Adobe Target. If you are not using A4T, you could go into the [!UICONTROL Advanced Settings] in the success metric and choose the option that increments the count and then bars from re-entry. In order for it to work properly you would have to convert right away, like on user seeing \*\*any mbox\*\*.

Or if you have full control over the mbox call (ability to add mbox params to it) then you could add a unique mbox param such as `isPopup=true` and then create an profile script which looks for that param and then sets a user variable, ie `user.hasSeenPopUp`.





The same idea could work if the popup had a had a unique mbox name.

You would then create an audience where `user.hasSeenPopup` does not exist or does not contain true and place that audience on the activity.
