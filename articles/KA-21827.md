# About importing Adobe Target feed files


This article addresses an inquiry regarding Adobe Target's recommendation feed updates. The article clarifies that when importing a new set of values, only updated or new values will be incorporated into the existing data, with no overwriting of all values on each upload.

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Target

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

When importing recommendation feeds, are all values overwritten each time one uploads? Or is only the difference between the modified values overwritten?


## Resolution {#resolution}


For recommendation feeds, all values are updated only on the first upload. Subsequent uploads will only update the values that have changed.

In other words, only the new values are updated compared to the existing values.
