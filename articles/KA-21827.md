# About importing Adobe Target feed files

## Description {#description}

I am importing recommendation feeds. Are all values overwritten each time I upload? Or is only the difference between the modified values overwritten?

## Resolution {#resolution}


For recommendation feeds, all values are updated only on the first upload. Subsequent uploads will only update the values that have changed. In other words, only the new values are updated compared to the existing values.
