# Seed addresses get duplicated when recurring delivery is executed

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

- Adobe Campaign
- Adobe Campaign Classic


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

When you add a new seed address in a recurring delivery, every time the recurring delivery is executed and a new delivery instance is created, a new seed address is created as well (with the same characteristics, but a different id/internal name).

To reproduce the issue:

1. Create a new campaign and under its workflow, add a new recurring delivery.
2. In the new recurring delivery, add a new seed address and save. Under the seed addresses folder, check that the new seed address is created.
3. Execute the recurring delivery. This creates a duplicated seed address that is used in the new delivery instance.



## Resolution {#resolution}


This is working as designed. An improvement request is currently active under [NEO-12892](https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/NEO-12892) to get this changed.

In the meantime, customers should use seed with dynamic conditions to avoid duplication:
