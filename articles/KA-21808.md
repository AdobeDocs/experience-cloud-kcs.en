# References not updated during rollout for inner Live Copy


When references are not updated during the rollout for inner Live Copy, enable a specific configuration for the Multi-Site Manager (MSM) Update Action to *Update Reference across nested LiveCopies*. Follow the steps outlined in this article to resolve the issue.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Experience Manager as a Cloud Service
- Experience Manager 6.5


### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

When creating some nested/inner Live copies, the references in the content of the page will not be updated to their live-copy equivalent during the Rollout (they will instead reference the Blueprint path).

An inner Live Copy can be created due to multiple reasons:

- either by creating them manually (<b>Create</b> `>`  <b>Live Copy</b>)
- or by editing the <b>Live Copy</b> properties of a sub-page from a Live Copy root




For example, considering the WKND sample website, having the following BluePrint/LiveCopy structure:

- <b>Blueprint:</b> /content/wknd/language-masters/en
- <b>Live copy:</b> /content/wknd/us/en and /content/wknd/ca/en


Now, if one opens the Page properties for the page */content/wknd/us/en/magazine/ski-touring* (sub-page within the */content/wknd/us/en* Live Copy).

Going to the <b>Live Copy</b> tab and changing either of the properties (<b>Live Copy Inheritance</b>, <b>Inherit Rollout Configs from Parent</b>, ...) will create an inner Live Copy.

This can be seen from the presence/creation of a *cq:LiveSyncConfig* at */content/wknd/us/en/magazine/ski-touring/jcr:content/cq:LiveSyncConfig*.

The Blueprint Live Copy dashboard (go to the BP page properties then go to Blueprint then go to Live Copy Overview) will also change from:

to:

## Resolution {#resolution}


To have references correctly rewritten on the inner Live Copy, it is required to enable a specific configuration for the Multi-Site Manager (MSM) Update Action in order to *Update Reference across nested LiveCopies*.

<b>For more information see the corresponding documentation:</b>

Follow these steps to either deploy an Open Service Gateway Initiative (OSGi) configuration file or perform a change from the OSGi Web Console when applicable:

1. Access the <b>Web Console</b> then go to <b>OSGi</b> then go to <b>Configuration</b> [(http://localhost/system/console/configMgr)](http://localhost/system/console/configMgr)


2. Search for the <b>CQ MSM References Update Action</b> (`com.day.cq.wcm.msm.impl.actions.ReferencesUpdateActionFactory`)


3. Activate the checkbox <b>Update Reference across nested LiveCopies</b>
