# References not updated during Rollout for inner Live copy

## Description {#description}


<b>Description</b> :

When having some nested/inner Live copies, the references in the content of the page will not be updated to their live-copy equivalent during the Rollout (they will instead reference the Blueprint path).

An inner Live Copy can be created due to multiple reasons:

- either by creating them manually ("Create  Live Copy")
- or by editing the "Live Copy" properties of a sub-page from a Live Copy root




For example, considering the WKND sample Website, having the following BluePrint/LiveCopy structure:

- Blueprint : /content/wknd/language-masters/en

- Live copy : /content/wknd/us/en and /content/wknd/ca/en

Now, if one opens the Page properties for the page "/content/wknd/us/en/magazine/ski-touring" (sub-page within the "/content/wknd/us/en" Live Copy).

Going to the "Live Copy" tab and change either of the properties ("Live Copy Inheritance", "Inherit Rollout Configs from Parent", ...) will create an inner Live Copy.

This can be seen from the presence/creation of a "cq:LiveSyncConfig" at "/content/wknd/us/en/magazine/ski-touring/jcr:content/cq:LiveSyncConfig".

The Blueprint Live Copy dashboard (go to the BP page properties  Blueprint  Live Copy Overview) will also change from:

to:

## Resolution {#resolution}


To have references correctly rewritten on the inner live copy, it is required to enable a specific configuration for the MSM Update Action in order to "Update Reference across nested LiveCopies".

See the corresponding documentation:

[https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/sites/administering/reusing-content/msm/live-copy-sync-config.html?lang=en#configuring-synchronization-for-updating-references](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/sites/administering/reusing-content/msm/live-copy-sync-config.html?lang=en#configuring-synchronization-for-updating-references)

[https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/administering/introduction/msm-sync.html?lang=en#configuring-synchronization-for-updating-references](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/administering/introduction/msm-sync.html?lang=en#configuring-synchronization-for-updating-references)



The operation consists to either deploy an OSGi configuration file or performs the change from the OSGi Web Console when applicable:
1. access the Web Console  OSGi  Configuration (http://localhost/system/console/configMgr)
2. search for the "CQ MSM References Update Action (com.day.cq.wcm.msm.impl.actions.ReferencesUpdateActionFactory)"
3. activate the checkbox "Update Reference across nested LiveCopies"
