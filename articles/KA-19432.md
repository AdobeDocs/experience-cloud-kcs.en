# Missing tracking information : Message Centre Template

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

- Adobe Campaign Classic

- Adobe Campaign Classic v7

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

In certain cases, after you publish a template (from your Marketing instance to the message center) and send out emails, the tracking information (only for the deliveries of that particular template) is not seen.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Resolution - Please always check the "tracking and images" section in the Delivery. Two points which are important here:

1.  The <b>Activate Tracking</b> & <b>Opens Tracking</b> must be ticked.

2.  Check the <b>Images</b> tab in the "tracking and images" section in the delivery template, there should not be any error with respect to the images hosting.
