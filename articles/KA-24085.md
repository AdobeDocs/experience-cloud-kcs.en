What happens when the Default Dashboard object is changed in Marketo Measure?


## Resolution {#resolution}


When you change the Default Dashboard object in Marketo Measure, the segmentation categories and stage mapping on the custom model will be reset.

- *Segmentation categories will be reset.*    
    You can only set Segmentation for Lead or Contact, depending on what is set as the Default Dashboard object. The fields related to the object will be the criteria available when setting up your segmentation categories in Measure. (Opportunity segmentation is available regardless of the Default Dashboard object.)
- *Stage mapping on the Custom Model will be reset.*    
    The Default Dashboard Object defines whether you pull fromÂ Lead or Contact for your funnel stages for the Custom Model. You can only pull stages from one object into settings.
    
    Picking the Lead object will import all Lead statuses into the Stage Mapping page for potential use in the Custom Model. You can also create custom logic based on other Lead fields if you need to (Lead.MQL Date, for example).
    
    Alternatively, you can pick Contact and all Contact statuses on the Stage Mapping page for potential use in the Custom Model. You can also create custom logic based on other Contact fields if you need to (Contact.MQL Date, for example).


<b>Note:</b>
By default, the Lead object is selected in Measure as the Dashboard object.

The selection is primarily based on the organization you use in your CRM.

Switching the Dashboard object will trigger a reprocess of touchpoint data.

As a best practice, you should avoid switching the Dashboard object several times.
