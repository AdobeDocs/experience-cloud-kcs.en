# Campaign: How long do deliveries collect tracking data?


Learn how long the tracking data is stored on the server in Adobe Campaign.

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Campaign

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

1. When do the links in the email to recipients stop working and clicks are no longer recorded?
2. What is the length of time the tracking data is stored on the server?



## Resolution {#resolution}


1. This is dependent on the Resource Validity configuration within the delivery properties. There, you can define how long the delivery mirror pages last before expiring. Once that time is reached, the links stop working, and clicks will no longer be recorded. For detailed steps, refer to [Define the validity period](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/key-steps-when-creating-a-delivery/steps-sending-the-delivery.html?lang=en#defining-validity-period) in *Configure and send the delivery* in [Campaign Classic v7 Documentation.](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/campaign-classic)
2. Check what you set in the retention settings configured through the deployment wizard. To have data purged off the server, adjust the tracking logs day limit in the deployment wizard. For detailed steps, refer to [Purging data](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/installing-campaign-classic/initial-configuration/deploying-an-instance.html?lang=en#purging-data) in *Deploying an instance* in [Campaign Classic v7 Documentation.](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/campaign-classic)
