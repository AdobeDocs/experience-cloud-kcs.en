# No tracking links created during delivery analysis

## Description


Error "<b>URL-140038 A content model fragment is badly configured.</b>" is received during delivery analysis. Post that, no tracking links are created, the analysis completes and the delivery is sent out without any tracking link.


## Resolution


In your email HTML search <b>nl-dce-content-model</b>, the fragment which has this, is the one that you need.

For example:

<b>div class="is-locked nl-dce-content-model acr-fragment" style="padding:0;" data-fragment-id="\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*" data-fragment-ref="" data-fragment-name="CPL header (CMDL19)" data-nl-name="\*\*\*"</b>

Here the fragment is<b> data-fragment-name="CPL header (CMDL19)". </b>Search for the same in the Content Fragments and follow the below:

1. You will have to go to the fragment creation and update the fragment, roughly save it again.
2. Then come back to your delivery open it, wait a few second to let the system detect that the fragment has been updated.
3. Check that<b> nl-dce-content-model</b> has been correctly removed.
4. Save and you are good to go.
