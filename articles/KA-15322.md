# No tracking links created during delivery analysis

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Campaign Standard
 Adobe Campaign

<b>Issue</b>
 During delivery analysis, you receive an error similar to:


```
URL-140038 A content model fragment is badly configured.
```


After that, no tracking links are created, the analysis completes, and the delivery is sent out without any tracking link.


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>

In your email HTML search for `nl-dce-content-model`, the fragment which has this in it, is the one that you need.

For example:

<b>div class="is-locked nl-dce-content-model acr-fragment" style="padding:0;" data-fragment-id="\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*" data-fragment-ref="" data-fragment-name="CPL header (CMDL19)" data-nl-name="\*\*\*"</b>

Here the fragment is<b> data-fragment-name="CPL header (CMDL19)". </b>Search for the same in the Content Fragments and follow the below:
