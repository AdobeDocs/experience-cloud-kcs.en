# No tracking links created during delivery analysis


Go to the fragment creation and update the fragment, then roughly save it again. Then come back to your delivery, open it, and wait a few seconds to let the system detect that the fragment has been updated. Check that `nl-dce-content-model` has been correctly removed.

## Description {#description}


<b>Environments</b>
 Adobe Campaign (AC)
 Adobe Campaign Standard (ACS)

<b>Issue</b>
 During delivery analysis, you receive an error similar to:


```
URL-140038 A content model fragment is badly configured.
```


After that, no tracking links are created, the analysis completes, and the delivery is sent out without any tracking link.


## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Solution</b>

In your email HTML search for `nl-dce-content-model`, the fragment which has this in it, is the one that you need.

For example:


```
<div class="is-locked nl-dce-content-model acr-fragment"  data-fragment-id="<b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><b>*" data-fragment-ref="" data-fragment-name="CPL header (CMDL19)" data-nl-name="</b>*">
```


Here the fragment is  `data-fragment-name="CPL header (CMDL19)"`.

Search for the same in the <b>Content Fragments</b> and follow these steps:

1. Go to the fragment creation and update the fragment, then roughly save it again.
2. Then come back to your delivery, open it, and wait a few seconds to let the system detect that the fragment has been updated.
3. Check that `nl-dce-content-model` has been correctly removed.
4. Then <b>Save</b>.
