    javax.jcr.RepositoryException: org.eclipse.jetty.io.EofException: Early EOF
    ```



## Resolution {#resolution}


AEM's web UI does not support the drag and drop of assets in folders. Instead, you can...

- Use the AEM Desktop application which does support this. You'll find information about the app and how to install it here:

    [https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/assets/creative-workflows/aem-desktop-app.html?lang=en](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/assets/creative-workflows/aem-desktop-app.html?lang=en)
- Compress the folder into a .zip, drag it into the assets, then select it and choose Extract Archive. 
    - Note: You can also add the Unarchiver step to the DAM UPDATE ASSET workflow model so that .zip files will automatically be unarchived when uploaded.
    - You can add these arguments to that step to have the .zip file deleted after the unarchiving, `removeOriginal::true,updateMode::OVERWRITE`
