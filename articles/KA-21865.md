# Drag and drop of a folder of assets to AEM Assets Web UI fails


AEM's web UI does not support the drag and drop of assets in folders, but there are a few workarounds.

## Description {#description}


<b>Environments</b>

- Adobe Experience Manager
- Adobe Experience Cloud Services


<b>Issue</b>

- The drag and drop of a folder that contains assets fails.
- The UI will show a message: `"1 of [ n]  assets failed"`
- The error.log will show a message:

    ```
    11.04.2023 12:16:52.464 *ERROR* 
        
    [ 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 [ 1681240612458]  POST /content/dam[ target folder name] .createasset.html HTTP/1.1]  com.day.cq.dam.api.AssetManager createAsset: repository exception while creating asset [ /content/dam/[ target foldername] [ dragged folder name] ] :
        
    javax.jcr.RepositoryException: org.eclipse.jetty.io.EofException: Early EOF
    ```



## Resolution {#resolution}


AEM's web UI does not support the drag and drop of assets in folders.

Instead, you can:

- Use the AEM Desktop application which does support this. You'll find information about the app and how to install it in [Use AEM Desktop App](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-learn/assets/creative-workflows/aem-desktop-app) in the AEM Tutorials.
- Compress the folder into a .zip, drag it into the assets, then select it and choose <b>Extract Archive</b>. 
    - Note: You can also add the Unarchiver step to the DAM UPDATE ASSET workflow model so that .zip files will automatically be unarchived when uploaded.
    - You can add these arguments to that step to have the .zip file deleted after the unarchiving, `removeOriginal::true,updateMode::OVERWRITE`
