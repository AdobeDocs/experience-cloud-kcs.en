# Unable to Add link to an Image on the page through VEC

## Description


Sometimes, you may be able to create the activity through VEC where you are adding a Link to the Image. However with the QA URL / content delivery, the link might not work.




## Resolution


This may be due to the fact that at.js polls all the selectors before loading the DOM elements and since this id of image is created on the run the next action of applying link on this id is not executed as the selector is not found.



In such scenarios, I would suggest making below changes to the activity where you are looking forward to edit the links of the image.

1. Edit the Activity

2. Click on the gear button and go to Site Preferences

3. Disable 'Use Element IDs' and Save it

4. Click on next and Save the activity

This should help to resolve the issue.
