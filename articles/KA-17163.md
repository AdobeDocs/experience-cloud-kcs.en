## Resolution {#resolution}


For any Product Profile to become available in the drop down while sharing a workspace project, it must have / have had any Analytics permission associated with it in Admin Console. Once any random permission is added to Product profile 'X', user should start seeing it i the drop down while sharing any Workspace project.

In the above example - Product Profile 'Test Profile X' was not available in dropdown option when it was newly created with no permissions. However, when we added permissions, it became available.

<b>Note:</b> If all the permissions assigned to Product profile 'X' is revoked in Admin Console, product profile 'X' would <b>still </b>continue to be available in the drop down for sharing project.
