## Resolution {#resolution}


For any Product Profile to become available in the drop-down while sharing a workspace project, it must have had any Analytics permission associated with it in the Admin Console. Once any random permission is added to Product profile 'X', the user should start seeing it in the drop-down while sharing any Workspace project.

In the above example - Product Profile 'Test Profile X' was not available in the drop-down option when it was newly created with no permissions. However, when we added permissions, it became available.

<b>Note:</b> If all the permissions assigned to Product profile 'X' are revoked in Admin Console, product profile 'X' will <b>still </b>continue to be available in the drop-down for sharing projects.
