## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Platform

## Resolution {#resolution}


"Events" tab shows data against events/requests received for a profile in real-time which does not include csv file upload.

Requests coming from `WebSDK/Alloy.js` or via any Streaming Method would result in data under "Events" tab.
