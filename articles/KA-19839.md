# Events are not visible for a profile in AEP

## Description

I am unable to see data for a profile under "Events" tab.<br><br> <br><br>![](assets/___06fe68f7-99e8-ec11-bb3c-000d3a3b168b___.png)<br><br> <br><br>
- I have created XDM Event Schema and dataset.
- Data Ingestion was done via csv file upload.



## Resolution


Events tab shows data against events/requests received for a profile in real-time which doesn't include csv file upload.

Requests coming from [!DNL WebSDK/Alloy.js] or via any Streaming Method would result in data under "Events" tab.
