# [ACS] Question Regarding ACS Profile API

## Description


Does anyone have experience with the insertion of many profiles via the ACS Profile API? Some questions:

- Are there any throttling mechanisms if too many calls are made?
- Are there any recommendations on max number of parallel requests?
- Do these calls count towards engine calls per day?
- Any other concerns with doing mass profile creation via API?


Best practice is to go with ETL activities via workflows, but just wanted to understand the limitations of going with the API route.


## Resolution


See the Product Description page for the API calls allowance ([https://helpx.adobe.com/legal/product-descriptions/campaign-standard.html](https://helpx.adobe.com/legal/product-descriptions/campaign-standard.html) ) otherwise, see response below.



- Are there any throttling mechanisms if too many calls are made?


There is none, customer has to do it on its side

- Are there any recommendations on max number of parallel requests?


See Product Description page for the max engine calls per second. Note that it is not enforced

- Do these calls count towards engine calls per day?


Yes they do

- Any other concerns with doing mass profile creation via API?


All depends how you do it, because in all my experience, a “*business’functional*” call results to at least 2 API calls (1 get and 1 post or patch). SO using API for build load profile is the worse way to inject profile for large volume. Look at the MS Dynamic connector, it takes it 8 or 9 hours to inject millions of records using the API, from an architecture point of view, ACS APIs aren’t viable for large volume in regular manners…. Move to file injection and run a workflow every 30mn if required….
