# Adobe Experience Manager: How to monitor a replication queue

## Description {#description}

When a publish process does not proceed as expected, a replication queue may be stuck. Monitoring a replication queue can help you notice it. This article explains how to monitor a replication queue.
 <br><b>Environments</b><br>AEM 6.5

## Resolution {#resolution}


You can obtain the list of contents in a replication queue by accessing the following URL.

Example:
 http://localhost:4502/etc/replication/agents.author/publish/jcr:content.queue.json
<br><br><br><br> <br><br><br>
Result:

{
 metaData: {
 root: "queue",
 queueStatus: {
 agentName: "Default Agent",
 agentId: "publish",
 isBlocked: false,
 isPaused: false,
 time: 1683837270303,
 processingSince: 1683837270301,
 lastProcessTime: 1683837270270,
 nextRetryPeriod: -1683837270304
 },
 fields: `[` 
 "id",
 "path",
 "time",
 "userid",
 "type",
 "size",
 "lastProcessed",
 "numProcessed"
 `]` 
 },
 queue: `[` 
 {
 id: "2023/5/12/5/34/c80e9a48-1b7e-4e12-8775-5f733016e13e_3646",
 path: "/content/we-retail/us/en/products/equipment/running/faba-running-pants",
 time: 1683837231021,
 userid: "admin",
 type: "Deactivate",
 size: 0,
 lastProcessed: 0,
 numProcessed: 0
 },

〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜

{
 id: "2023/5/12/5/34/c80e9a48-1b7e-4e12-8775-5f733016e13e_3695",
 path: "/content/we-retail/ca/en/products/equipment/hiking/expedition-tech-long-sleeved-shirt",
 time: 1683837231021,
 userid: "admin",
 type: "Deactivate",
 size: 0,
 lastProcessed: 0,
 numProcessed: 0
 }
 `]` 
 }

It is recommended to access the URL with cURL regularly. "path" value is a path of content. You can count the path value from the result to check the number of contents in a replication queue.

Example:
 curl -u `<` user`>` :`<` password`>`  "http://localhost:4502/etc/replication/agents.author/publish/jcr:content.queue.json"
