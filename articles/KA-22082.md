## Resolution {#resolution}


You can obtain the list of contents in a replication queue by accessing the following URL.

Example:
http://localhost:4502/etc/replication/agents.author/publish/jcr:content.queue.json

Result:

{
metaData: {
root: "queue",
queueStatus: {
agentName: "Default Agent",
agentId: "publish",
isBlocked: false,
isPaused: false,
time: 1683837270303,
processingSince: 1683837270301,
lastProcessTime: 1683837270270,
nextRetryPeriod: -1683837270304
},
fields: `[` 
"id",
"path",
"time",
"userid",
"type",
"size",
"lastProcessed",
"numProcessed"
`]` 
},
queue: `[` 
{
id: "2023/5/12/5/34/c80e9a48-1b7e-4e12-8775-5f733016e13e_3646",
path: "/content/we-retail/us/en/products/equipment/running/faba-running-pants",
time: 1683837231021,
userid: "admin",
type: "Deactivate",
size: 0,
lastProcessed: 0,
numProcessed: 0
},
{
id: "2023/5/12/5/34/c80e9a48-1b7e-4e12-8775-5f733016e13e_3695",
path: "/content/we-retail/ca/en/products/equipment/hiking/expedition-tech-long-sleeved-shirt",
time: 1683837231021,
userid: "admin",
type: "Deactivate",
size: 0,
lastProcessed: 0,
numProcessed: 0
}
`]` 
}



It is recommended to access the URL with cURL regularly. "path" value is a path of content. You can count the path value from the result to check the number of contents in a replication queue.

Example:
curl -u `<` user`>` :`<` password`>`  "http://localhost:4502/etc/replication/agents.author/publish/jcr:content.queue.json"
