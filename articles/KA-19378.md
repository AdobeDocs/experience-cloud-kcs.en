## Resolution {#resolution}


`mdmp` file is a compressed file created by Windows Server after a program shows an error or crashes. It contains data that has been "dumped" from the program's memory space.
It saves information about the error, which can be used for debugging. This can also be sent to Microsoft as part of a bug reporting process.



*MDMP*can be analyzed using *WinDmp*, a debugging program that is part of the Microsoft Windows SDK. Your server administrator would be able to help you with this.
