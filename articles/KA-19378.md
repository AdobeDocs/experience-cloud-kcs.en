# .mdmp files being created

## Description

Issue -Â The production environment is frequently seeing `.mdmp` files being created in the `/var/` directory. Can you please help us review the output as we are not sure what is causing this? Have attached the `.log` and `.mdmp` created.

<b>Note:</b> Applicable for On-Prem customers using [!DNL Windows] OS



## Resolution


mdmp file is a compressed file created by [!DNL Windows Server] after a program gets in error or crashes. It contains data "dumped" from the program's memory space. It saves information about the error, which can be used for debugging. They can also be sent to Microsoft as part of a bug reporting process.

MDMP can be analyzed using [!DNL WinDmp], a debugging program that is part of the [!DNL Microsoft Windows SDK]. Your Server administrator would be able to help you with this.
