| 5:00 PM | 2216 | 2213 | 2815 | 2444 | 1000 |


May appear as below after some time:


|   | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Thursday |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hour of Day | 7357 | 7491 | 7933 | 7695 | 10434 |

| 4:00 PM | 2892 | 3113 | 3867 | 3216 | 1374 |
| 5:00 PM | 2216 | 2213 | 2815 | 2444 | 1000 |



## Resolution


By default, in Workspace, when a customer brings in a dimension to the columns (like Day of Week here), it explodes into top 5 dynamic items for that dimension. If the customer does not want them to change with time, they need to right-click on them and select <b>Make item static.</b>

You can confirm, if the items are static, by *hovering over them* - there will be a lock icon that appears. That means the item is static and won't change with time.
