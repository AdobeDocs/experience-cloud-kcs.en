## Resolution


By default in Workspace, when a customer brings in a dimension to the columns (like Day of Week here), it explodes into top 5 dynamic items for that dimension. If the customer does not want them to change with time, they need to right-click on them and select "<b>Make item static.</b>"

You can confirm, if the items are static, by *hovering over them* - there will be a lock icon that appears. That means the item is static and won't change with time.
