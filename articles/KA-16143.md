## Resolution {#resolution}


By default, in Workspace, when you bring in a dimension to the columns (like Day of Week here), it explodes into the top 5 dynamic items for that dimension. If you do not want them to change with time, you need to right-click on them and select <b>Make item static.</b>

You can confirm, if the items are static, by *hovering over them* - there will be a lock icon that appears. That means the item is static and won't change with time.
