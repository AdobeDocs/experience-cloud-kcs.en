## Resolution


By default in [!UICONTROL Workspace], when a customer brings in a dimension to the columns (like [!UICONTROL Day of Week] here), it explodes into top 5 dynamic items for that dimension. If the customer does not want them to change with time, they need to right-click them and select "[!UICONTROL Make item static]".

You can confirm if the items are static by hovering over them - there will be a lock icon that appears. That means the item is static and won't change with time.
