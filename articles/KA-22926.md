# OOTB workflow scheduledEnhancedMTATypologyRule is throwing an error causing it to be paused


If the OOTB workflow `scheduledEnhancedMTATypologyRule` is throwing an error causing it to be paused, delete the extra linked records from a deleted typology.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Campaign Classic v8



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

The Out-of-the-box (OOTB) `scheduledEnhancedMTATypologyRule` workflow has an error - *Not all typologies were updated successfully*, which puts it in a paused state.

<b>Steps to reproduce:</b>

Go to the audit logs of the workflow `scheduledEnhancedMTATypologyRule` - an error *Not all typologies were updated successfully* is displayed in the logs.


## Resolution {#resolution}

Solution:<br>
Delete the extra records that are linked to a deleted typology.


<br>Cause:<br>
The error occurs because the number of typologies in the `nmsTypologyRuleRel` table differs from the `nmsTypologyRule` table for the typology `enhancedMTATypology`.

This happens when deleting a typology, data is removed from the `nmsTypologyRule` table but not from the `nmsTypologyRuleRel` table.
