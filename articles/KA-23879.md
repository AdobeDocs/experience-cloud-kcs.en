# Typology rule to add SMTP header applied but doesn’t change the internet header in the delivered message


This article will guide you through correctly applying typology rules to add a <b>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</b> (SMTP) header and modify the encoding of deliveries in Adobe Campaign Classic.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environments</b>

- Adobe Campaign Classic v7 (ACC v7)


- Adobe Campaign Classic v8 (ACC v8)




### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

A typology rule has been implemented to add SMTP headers and modify the encoding of deliveries. This rule is applied to a delivery that can be viewed in the delivery audit without any error or warning. However, upon receiving the delivery message, neither the SMTP header nor the modified/added encoding is visible in the internet header of the message.

<b>Steps to reproduce:</b>

1. Implement a control typology rule that adds SMTP headers and modifies the encoding of deliveries.


2. Add it to a delivery and send the delivery.


3. In the E-mail received, open the internet header and check the headers and the encoding. (neither the SMTP header is added, nor encoding is modified)



## Resolution {#resolution}


Change the <b>Phase</b> field in the <b>General</b> tab of the typology rule to: <b>*At the start of targeting.</b>*

*Note: For a detailed explanation, follow the Campaign Classic v7 documentation on [applying typology rules](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/orchestrating-campaigns/campaign-optimization/control-rules.html)*.
<b>Cause:</b>
For the typology rule to be correctly applied, it needs to be executed at the start of targeting.
