# PGS-220000 PostgreSQL error: relation "t1" does not exist


If you are getting an error: `PGS-220000 PostgreSQL error: relation "t1" does not exist...,` generated by the tracking workflow in the Adobe Campaign Classic v7, go through this article to understand how to resolve this issue.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Campaign Classic V7



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

After a recent build upgrade 9343 or higher, the following errors are generated by the tracking workflow:




```
nlmodule    PGS-220000 PostgreSQL error: ERROR:  relation "t1" does not exist LINE 1: ...t, T3.iArticle, T2.iType FROM NmsTrackingUrl T2,  T1 LEFT OU... nlmodule    WDB-200001 SQL statement 'SELECT T1.tsLog, T1.iDeliveryId, T1.iUrlId, T1.sSourceType, T3.dAmount, T3.iArticle, T2.iType FROM NmsTrackingUrl T2,  T1 LEFT OUTER JOIN NmsWebTrackingLog T3 ON iTrackingLogId = iWebTrackingLogId WHERE T1.tsLog < :#(1)# AND T1.tsLog >= :#(2)#  AND T1.iUrlId=T2.iTrackingUrlId ORDER BY T1.tsLog' could not be executed.   Param(0)=09/17/2020 8:55:00 PM   Param(1)=09/16/2020 8:55:00 PMnlmodule    Attribute 'broadLog-id' unknown (see definition of schema 'Tracking logs (nms:trackingLog)').
```





## Resolution {#resolution}


From the verbose tracking logs, one can see that the tracking workflow is failing at the end, of consolidating the data:




```

```




Every time the tracking workflow starts, it pulls all target mappings and updates the data based on the configuration.

In this case, one target mapping is causing the issue. Please see below:

Basically,<b> NMS: tracking log</b> schema should NOT be used for monitoring logs, because the schema is not related to a database (SQL) table.

In conclusion, the issue has nothing to do with the upgrade, but more with a bad target mapping configuration.
