# What is the difference between SMS delivery statuses: “Sent”,  "Sent to the provider", and “Received on Mobile”?


This article expounds upon the out-of-the-box delivery status documentation. Specifically, detailing the statuses of "Sent", "Sent to the Provider", and "Received on Mobile."





## Description {#description}

The question has been asked, that within the context of SMS delivery statuses in Adobe Campaign Classic (ACC), what is the difference between "Sent", "Sent to the provider", and "Received on Mobile"?<br> <br>While the out-of-the-box documentation below provides an overview, further explanation was required:<br>
[https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/monitoring-deliveries/delivery-statuses](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/monitoring-deliveries/delivery-statuses)

## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Answer:</b>

- Received on mobile is successfully received (MT + SR)
- Sent is MT successful, but no SR received
- Sent to the provider is SUBMIT_SM sent to the provider, but no SUBMIT_SM_RESP received from the provider.


It is normal to have some messages in the "sent" status because the SR (that turns Sent to Received) is sent by the recipient's mobile phone
So if they have poor cell reception for any reason, they won't receive it.
It is up to the provider to retry or to justify why no SR was received unless the provider justifies that Campaign did not behave as expected.

<b>Summary of SMS delivery statuses</b>:

- Pending: Not sent to the aggregator
- Taken into account by provider: Sent to the aggregator, and aggregator confirmed reception.
- Sent: Aggregator confirmed the message has been pushed to the cellphone without an immediate error.
- Received on Mobile: The cellphone confirmed the reception to the aggregator, and the aggregator confirmed to AC.
- Failed: Pushed to the aggregator. The aggregator tried to send to the cellphone (for X hours). The aggregator was not able to reach the cellphone for whatever reason.
