# PGS-220000 PostgreSQL error: ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "nmstrackingurl_tagid"

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign Classic
- Campaign Classic v7



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
The OOTB workflow for the Prime connector called `newRcpDeliveryLogReplication` fails with the error:

*PGS-220000 PostgreSQL error: ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "nmstrackingurl_tagid" DETAIL: Key (stagid) = (1c7bdec2) already exists.*


## Resolution {#resolution}


This error can be mitigated by updating the *Update tracking URLs (writerTrackingUrls)*activity in the workflow with the `ACS_` prefix to the *@tagId*source expression.

This error may occur in situations when both ACC and ACS instances are used to send emails with tracked URLs. Then a clash with duplicate *URL* *tagIds*may happen during the synchronization. By adding the prefix, we avoid creating duplicate records and workflow failure.
