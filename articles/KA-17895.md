# PGS-220000 PostgreSQL error: ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "nmstrackingurl_tagid"

## Description


The OOTB workflow for the Prime connector called newRcpDeliveryLogReplication fails with the error:

PGS-220000 PostgreSQL error: ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "nmstrackingurl_tagid" DETAIL: Key (stagid) = (1c7bdec2) already exists.


## Resolution


This can be mitigated by updating the "Update tracking URLs" (writerTrackingUrls) activity in the workflow with the "ACS_"prefix to the @tagId source expression.

This error may occur in situations when both ACC and ACS instances are used to send emails with tracked URLs. Then a clash with duplicate URL tagIds may happen during the synchronization. By adding the prefix we avoid creating duplicate records and the workflow failure.
