# Processing order of Analytics hits sharing the same timestamp

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- Customer Journey Analytics
- Analytics



<b>Issues/Symptoms</b><br>How are hits in the same second processed?<br>Does Adobe Analytic support sub-second hit ordering?

## Resolution {#resolution}


Currently, Adobe Analytics truncates timestamps at the second level.

There are no ordering guarantees with events timestamped within the same second.

This may affect reports such as Marketing Channels; wherein a link call `(s.tl)` is the first hit processed within a visit and a new channel is set on a following hit in a standard tracking `(s.t)` call.

If a specific hit order is required, delaying subsequent calls to fire in sequence would be advised.
