# What is the processing order of [!DNL Analytics] hits sharing the same timestamp - down to the second?

## Description

How are hits in the same second ordered?<br><br>Does Adobe Analytics support sub-second hit ordering?

## Resolution


Currently, Adobe Analytics truncates timestamps at the second level.

There are no ordering guarantees with events timestamped within the same second.

This may affect reports such as [!UICONTROL Marketing Channels]; wherein a link call (s.tl) is the first hit processed within a visit and a new channel is set on a following hit in a standard tracking (s.t) call.

If a specific hit order is required, delaying subsequent calls to fire in sequence would be advised.
