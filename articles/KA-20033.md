## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Target

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

The option "Allow recently purchased items to be recommended" on the criteria creation UI requests permission to recommend/not recommend previously purchased items. What is the lookback window for "recently"?


## Resolution {#resolution}


This option is to recommend/not recommend the items that the specific visitor had previously purchased. Lookback window for "recently" defines the lifetime of the visitor profile. By default, a visitor profile expires after 14 days of inactivity.
