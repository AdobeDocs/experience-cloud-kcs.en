# Does Activity Map work on cross-domain tracking?

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- Analytics

<br> <br><b>Issue/Symptoms</b><br>After launching the Activity Map plug-in, the clicks of some links are showing as 0. However, the destination page in a different domain shows up when clicking these links. Does Activity Map work on cross-domain tracking?<br>

## Resolution {#resolution}


No. Activity Map only works on the same domain.

When you click a link on the page, Activity Map stores the link data into a first-party cookie. And then set into Activity Map context data variables which will be sent with Analytics page view calls on the subsequent page.
