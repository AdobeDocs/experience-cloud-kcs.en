# Does Activity Map work on cross-domain tracking?

## Description

After launching the Activity Map plug-in, the Clicks of some links are showing as 0. However, the destination page in a different domain shows up when clicking these links. Does Activity Map work on cross-domain tracking?

## Resolution


No. Activity Map only works on the same domain.

When you click a link on the page, Activity Map stores the link data into a first-party cookie. And then set intoÂ Activity Map context data variables which will be sent with Analytics page view calls on the subsequent page.
