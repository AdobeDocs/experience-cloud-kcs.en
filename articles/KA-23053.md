## Resolution {#resolution}

<b>Solution:</b>
The difference between the domain of error address and the domain of sender address indicates that the delivery is not using the domain's routing. The customer should review the definition of the delivery and change the routing to the correct external account.
<b>Cause</b>
This happens because the domain of the error address on the e-mail delivery is different than the domain of the sender address.
