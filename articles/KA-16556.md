# Emoticon Enumerations

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign Classic
- Campaign
- Campaign Standard



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
According to the [following](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/personalizing-deliveries/customizing-emoticon-list.html?lang=en#add-new-emoticon) document, we can have OOTB Emoticon-list under Enumerations.
[https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/personalizing-deliveries/customizing-emoticon-list.html?lang=en#add-new-emoticon](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/personalizing-deliveries/customizing-emoticon-list.html?lang=en#add-new-emoticon)

 But the user does not see this list. Is there any package that needs to be installed or anything else that needs to be configured?

## Resolution


This was a new feature introduced in 9178. Check out the [Release notes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/release-notes/previous-releases/release--20-2.html?lang=en#release-20-2-1-build-9178) in Experience League documentation for more information.

Note that the user needs to be on the same console version as the Server build to expose the emoticons menu.
