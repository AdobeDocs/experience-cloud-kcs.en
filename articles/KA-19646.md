# How to cancel a "Data Warehouse" request created by another user

## Description

I want to cancel a "Data Warehouse" request created by another user. How can I do this?

## Resolution


The cancellation can be performed by Adobe Analytics admins in the Data Warehouse Request Manager.

System admins in your organization can give users the Adobe Analytics admin roll by granting the Product admin privilege for Adobe Analytics in Admin Console. (https://adminconsole.adobe.com)
