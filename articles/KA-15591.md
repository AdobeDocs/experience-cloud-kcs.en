# Category Affinity not working

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Target

<b>Issue</b>
 After having already implemented Category Affinity (through Adobe Launch) on our website following the guidelines (See the [Category Affinity](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/target/using/audiences/visitor-profiles/category-affinity.html "Click to follow link https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/target/using/audiences/visitor-profiles/category-affinity.html") article in the Adobe Target Documentation in Adobe Experience League.), you see that the category information is correctly passed in the call to Adobe Target.
  
 However, it appears that no category affinity is being calculated based in this input.

When you look into your profile using the debugging tool, the value of `user.categoryAffinity` remains empty, no matter how many pages with category you visit.


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>
To solve this issue, start debugging implementation by looking at the visitor profile in debug mode:

1. Create a profile script to show the category affinity. This may be always empty.
2. Create an activity.
3. Review your profile scripts and make a small modification to make it work:


<u>Before</u>:


```
return user.categoryAffinity || "onbestaand";
```


<u>After</u>:


```
var affinity = user.categoryAffinity || "onbestaand";
return affinity;
```
