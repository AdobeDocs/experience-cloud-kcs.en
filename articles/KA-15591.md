# Category Affinity not working

## Description

<br><br>Have implemented Category Affinity (through Adobe Launch) on our website following the guidelines ([https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/target/using/audiences/visitor-profiles/category-affinity.html](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/target/using/audiences/visitor-profiles/category-affinity.html "Click to follow link https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/target/using/audiences/visitor-profiles/category-affinity.html")). As a result, we can see that the category information is correctly passed in the call to Adobe Target
<br> 
<br>However, it appears that no category affinity is being calculated based in this input. When I look into my profile using the debugging tool, the value of user.categoryAffinity remains empty. No matter how many pages with category I visit.<br><br><br><br><br>

## Resolution


Debugging implementation by looking at the visitor profile in debug mode:

à I had created a profile script to show the category affinity, but this one was always empty

à when I created an activity , I saw that it did work

à I then reviewed my profile scripts and made a small modification which made it work:



Before

return user.categoryAffinity || "onbestaand";



After

var affinity = user.categoryAffinity || "onbestaand";

return affinity;
