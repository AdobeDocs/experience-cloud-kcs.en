# Replication not confirmed: schema:'nms:dlvMidRemoteIdRel', id(s): 'XXXXXXX'


To solve the data replication issue, update the <b>`<` replicationThreadPool Â keepConfirmationsDelay=""`>` </b> parameter in the serverConf.xml file.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Classic v8

### Issue/Symptoms

A large delivery with targeted recipients (personalization and at least 10m recipients) fails with the following error:

*The delivery has failed XSV-350122 An error occurred and the process has been stopped. SOP-330011 Error while executing the method 'PrepareMessageImpl' of service 'nms:delivery'. Replication not confirmed: schema:'nms:dlvMidRemoteIdRel', id(s): 'XXXXXXX'*


## Resolution {#resolution}


Update the following parameter in the serverConf.xml file:

<b>`<` replicationthreadpool keepconfirmationsdelay="3600"`>` </b>

This increases the cache to sixty minutes.

### Cause

The result of the asynchronous replication data of nms:dlvMidRemoteIdRel is kept in cache for 10 minutes. However, if the delivery target is very large, the preparation process can take more than 10 minutes, and the delivery fails.
