# Reverting a page to an old version changes the order of sibling pages


Grant read permission to all sibling pages.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)



### <b>Issue</b>

When a user reverts a page to an old version from the site's timeline, the order of sibling pages changes unintentionally. This issue happens only with the members of a particular group. Not with the admin.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Grant read permission to all sibling pages. To avoid the user seeing the page contents which are irrelevant, add *Deny* of `jcr;all rep:glob=*/jcr:content/*` on each
sibling page node (the node of `sling:resourceType = cq:Page`). The user can recognize the existence of the sibling pages (and the child pages of the sibling pages), but cannot see the contents of those.
<b>Cause</b>
The user/group has insufficient read permission to the sibling pages. The version keeps and tries to restore the order of sibling pages that the user can recognize. If the order is A -`>`  B -`>`  C and a user has read permission only on B and C, then when the user saves a version of C, it reverts to the saved version. AEM will restore the order of B -`>`  C first and does not care about the order for A. As a consequence, the sibling order may become B -`>`  C -`>`  A.
