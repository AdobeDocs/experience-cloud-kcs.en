# Can sent email "From:" address be changed after sharing Brand Portal asset


Adobe Experience Manager Assets Brand Portal is utilized for sharing and distributing assets. The emails are dispatched from the *no-reply@adobe.com* address. Currently, it is not possible to alter the*From:* *email address*, but this functionality is expected to be available in a future update.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Adobe Experience Manager
- Adobe Experience Manager Assets Brand Portal




### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Brand Portal is used to share and distribute assets.

Email is sent from the `no-reply@adobe.com` email address.

How can the *From: email address* be changed to the company's email address?


## Resolution {#resolution}


Brand Portal is a multi-tenant setup, allowing every customer/tenant to setup their own *From: email address* as a feature request.

Brand Portal is hosted in Adobe datacenters.

If the *From: email address*domain (for example, your email address domain) is different from where the email was routed, it would likely end up in a spam folder.

Since the *From: email address* is `noreply@adobe.com` and the initial routing mail server is also within Adobe, the email won't end up in a spam folder.

It is not currently possible to change the *From: email address* to any other address. This issue will be addressed in a future release.
