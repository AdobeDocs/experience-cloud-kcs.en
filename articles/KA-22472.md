# AEM installation error "No style has been found until search path threshold"

## Description {#description}


### Environment

- Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) v.6.5
- AEM as a Cloud Service


### Issue/Symptoms

After installing AEM 6.5.17, many log messages with `No style has been found until search path threshold` may appear upon accessing particular pages.


```
*ERROR* [ NN.NN.NN.NN [ 1681216960934]  GET /content/path/to/heavy-page.html HTTP/1.1]  com.day.cq.wcm.core.impl.designer.SearchPathLimiter 
No style has been found until search path threshold: 10000 was reached.
```


This article explains the cause and how to cope with the error.


## Resolution {#resolution}


When page content has a deep node hierarchy with nested containers, AEM takes a long time to search for styles for each component. Sometimes the response time becomes very long, even up to a few hours.

<u>Example</u>:


```
Page
  Layout container 1
    Layout container 2
      Layout container 3
        Layout container 4
          Layout container 5
            :
            Text component
```


To improve the response time, AEM 6.5.17 introduced a circuit breaker for searching the styles. When AEM terminates the search, it logs `No style has been found until search path threshold` in the error.log.

Check if the page of the error is displayed correctly, as that implies there may be a layout corruption by missing a style.

<b>Long-term solution</b>

Consider reducing the nesting hierarchy of the page content.

<b>Tentative workaround</b>

Increasing the upper limit of the circuit breaker will reduce the error frequency.

To find the upper limit, go to <b>Web console</b> `>`  <b>OSGi</b> `>`  <b>Configuration</b> `>`  <b>Designer Factory Configuration</b> `>`  <b>search path threshold</b>.

This parameter has a default value of 10000. If there is no performance issue with the page where the error appears, it should be fine with a large number, e.g., 1000000.
