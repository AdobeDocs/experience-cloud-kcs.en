# PDF naming conventions in DynamicMedia / DMS7


My pdf after upload into DM is called assetnamepdf without a dot. How come?

## Description {#description}


<b>What is the naming convention for pdfs uploaded into DynamicMedia?</b>


## Resolution {#resolution}


Historically, the main purpose for the upload of PDF assets into DM was
 to create an asset called an eCatalog which can be viewed in the
 html5 eCatalog viewer.
 This workflow has always been maintained in the setup.
 There are 2 ways of uploading a pdf into DMS7, or synchronizing a pdf
 from AEM to DMS7:
 1) without any kind of processing (jobOptions - pdfprocessing=none)
 if you would upload a pdf called "abc.pdf" with this option, the pdf in
 the DMS7 system will be called "abc".
 Since a pdf is a static asset however, and VirtualID serving of static
 assets is per default turned on, you can also request the pdf with the
 full path+extension. If it was uploaded into the root folder of your
 production instance called "company", it could be requested as
 http://server.scene7.com/is/content/company/abc.pdf
 if it would be in a subfolder called "subfolder", then the URL would be:
 http://server.scene7.com/is/content/company/subfolder/abc.pdf

 2) with any processing (pdfprocess=thumbnail or any other option)
 With this option, the ID of the asset itself is reserved for the
 eCatalog
 The ID with -1, -2 etc is for the page images
 The ID with pdf attached is for the original pdf file, which is per
 default not published, even though a publish action is indicated as part
 of the upload.
 example
 abc - eCatalog
 abc-1 - image of the first page
 abc-2 - image of the 2nd page etc.
 abcpdf - original pdf
 The full path pdf calling above also works for this option, but you'd
 need to explicitly make sure it is published, since it will not be
 automatically.

 This is the way the naming convention for PDF files has always been and
 is intended to be for DynamicMedia.
