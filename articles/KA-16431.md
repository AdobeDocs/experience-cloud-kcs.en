# Campaign Classic - Disabled message center email but mails still getting triggered

## Description


As a part of our business requirement, we had to disable/ switch off a few of our message center mails and SMS. To achieve the following, we created a dummy eventType and selected in the email properties, published it, tested and still received the mail from the original eventType.
 Then we changed the existing eventTypes of the emails and SMS to 'xxxxx_old' and went back to email properties, selected the 'xxxxx_old'Â  eventtype, and published, yet we received the mail from the original eventType while testing.

 Is there any way to disable message center emails ? OR how much time does it take for the eventType to be associated with the email after publishing the template?
 Please confirm once we publish the template then is there any way to disable it in Adobe Campaign Classic?


## Resolution


Customers whose Message Center instances are hosted by Adobe should contact Adobe Campaign Support to perform the steps below:

1. Stop the rtEventprocessing workflow
2. Go to the respective folder on RT instance possibly Administration  Production  Message Center  Deliveries  2020  10. Check for the continuous delivery which is still being used for that event. The child delivery is still using the old event type.
3. Most customers have a setting to have one child delivery per month. If yours is per day/week, then perform the next step for child delivery of the current week/day.
4. Stop the delivery. You can perform a mass update to change the status to Stopped/Failed
5. Start the rtEventProcessing workflow.
