# Disabled message center email but mails still getting triggered


This article addresses the Adobe Campaign issue where message center emails are getting triggered despite being disabled.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Classic

### Issue

To meet business requirements, Adobe Campaign can disable/switch-off a few of our message center mails and SMS.

To achieve the following, a dummy `eventType` was created and selected in the email properties, published it, tested and still received the mail from the original `eventType`.

Then we changed the existing eventTypes of the emails and SMS to *xxxxx_old* and went back to email properties, selected the *xxxxx_old*  eventType, and published, yet we received the mail from the original `eventType` while testing.

<u>Questions</u>:

Can you disable message center emails?

Or also, how much time does it take for the `eventType` to be associated with the email after publishing the template?

Once the template is published, is there any way to disable it in Adobe Campaign Classic?


## Resolution {#resolution}


If your Message Center instances are hosted by Adobe, contact Adobe Campaign Support to perform the steps below:

1. Stop the `rtEventprocessing` workflow.
2. Go to the respective folder on RT instance, which may be similar to <b>Administration</b> `>`  <b>Production</b> `>`  <b>Message Center</b> `>`  <b>Deliveries</b> `>`  <b>2020</b> `>`  <b>10</b>.

    Check for continuous delivery that is still being used for that event.

    The child delivery is still using the old event type.
3. Most customers have a setting to have one child delivery per month.

    If yours is per day/week, then perform the next step for child delivery of the current week/day.
4. Stop the delivery. You can perform a mass update to change the status to either *Stopped*/*Failed*.
5. Start the `rtEventProcessing` workflow.
