# How should a customer proceed when they want to perform a PEN test

## Description


A customer might have security policy where they need to perform a PEN test on the systems they use.
This can include Adobe managed systems, like AEMaaCS, AEM MS, or AEM Assetsd BrandPortal


## Resolution


In order to be able to proceed with the PEN test, the customer will need to get in touch with their CSM who will fill out a non-disclosure form with them.
The CSM can find this form on Inside Adobe
