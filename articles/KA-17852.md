# Targeted A/B test size too small

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
Content Standard


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
If you send a Subject based A/B test and find the Target size flagged as a warning too small (no documentation mentions minimum target sizes). The winning variant was manually selected when the follow-up deliveries weren't selecting a winner.




|     Test population extraction: 1622 messages for each of the 2 variants (total population 32451)     |
| --- |
|     Test segment size is too small for A/B testing: '1622' for a recommended minimum of '3245'     |



## Resolution {#resolution}


It is for the significance of the AB Test to be conducted. If the total population is less than 50k, the learning population needs to be at least 10% of the total population.
