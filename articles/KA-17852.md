# Targeted A/B test size too small


This article discusses the Campaign Standard issue whereÂ the Target size is flagged as a warning for being too small in an A/B test. This can be attributed to the percentage of the learning population with respect to the total population.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Campaign Standard

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

You send a Subject based A/B test and find that the Target size is flagged as a warning for being too small (no documentation mentions minimum target sizes). The winning variant was manually selected when the follow-up deliveries weren't selecting a winner.


|     Test population extraction: 1622 messages for each of the 2 variants (total population 32451)     |
| --- |
|     Test segment size is too small for A/B testing: '1622' for a recommended minimum of '3245'     |



## Resolution {#resolution}


This depends on the significance of the A/B Test to be conducted. If the total population is less than 50k, the learning population needs to be at least 10% of the total population.
