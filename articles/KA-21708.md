# Updating 'Structure Only' doesn't update content of a language copy


If a content change is required, the user will have to manually promote the launch.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)

<b>Issue</b>

Using the <b>Structure Only</b> option while updating a language copy doesn't update the content of the page.

<b>Steps to reproduce</b>

1. Create a new language copy (i.e., ES) using the <b>Structure Only</b> option.
2. Edit the English/Master page by adding text.
3. Update the ES language copy of that page using the <b>Structure Only</b> option.
4. Notice that the changes made in step 2 aren't updated.



## Resolution {#resolution}


If a content change is required, the user will have to manually promote the launch.


<b>Cause</b>
This is the intended behavior. <b>Structure Only</b> updates do not promote the launch, so the content is not updated.
