# Adobe Experience Manager: Dispatcher cache files are updated unexpectedly

## Description


Sometimes you may find that Dispatcher cache files are updated at an unexpected time or frequency. This article explains how to analyze such a situation.

<b>Environments</b>
AEM as a Cloud Service, AEM 6.5


## Resolution


Upon publishing content, AEM sends a cache invalidation request (GET [!DNL /dispatcher/invalidate].cache) to the Dispatcher. After that, when a request for the content comes to the Dispatcher, it updates its cache files.

Based on this behavior, look for a pattern by collecting the logs about the cache invalidation requests and the content requests.

Example logs for an invalidation request:
<br>Dispatcher - access_log


```
127.0.0.1 - - 07/Jun/2022:13:44:35 +0900 "GET /dispatcher/invalidate.cache HTTP/1.1" 200 13 "about:blank" "Jakarta Commons-HttpClient/3.1"
```

<br>Dispatcher - dispatcher.log


```
07/Jun/2022:13:44:35 +0900 "GET /dispatcher/invalidate.cache HTTP/1.1" 200 purge publish/- 0ms
```

<br>Publish - error.log


```

```




<b>Cause</b>

Here are typical cases where the Dispatcher cache files are updated unexpectedly.


<u>Case 1 - Frequent cache updates for unexpected contents</u>

Cache files are updated frequently, but the updated contents are not the target of the cache invalidation request.

In this case, the value of /statfileslevel in the Dispatcher configuration may be too low. Note that commenting out /statfileslevel in dispatcher.any means "0" for this value.

When you have /statfileslevel "0" and publish content, all the cache files are invalidated regardless of the paths. The reference describes the detail.

<u>Case 2 - Cache invalidation requests from an undesired client</u>

The Dispatcher configuration may not have an appropriate restriction for cache invalidation requests. Check /allowedClients in dispatcher.any.


<u>Case 3 - No cache invalidation requests</u>

The Dispatcher configuration may use time-based cache invalidation. In this case, /enableTTL "1" should exist in dispatcher.any.
