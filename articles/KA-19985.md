# Dispatcher cache files are updated unexpectedly | AEM


Look for a pattern by collecting the logs about the cache invalidation requests and the content requests. Check for the 3 different scenarios in the Resolution section.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)

### <b>Issue</b>

Sometimes Dispatcher cache files are updated at an unexpected time or frequency.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Upon publishing content, Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) sends a cache invalidation request (GET /dispatcher/invalidate.cache) to the Dispatcher. After that, when a request for the content comes to the Dispatcher, it updates its cache files.

Based on this behavior, look for a pattern by collecting the logs about the cache invalidation requests and the content requests.

Example logs for an invalidation request:
Dispatcher - access_log<br>

```
127.0.0.1 - - [ 07/Jun/2022:13:44:35 +0900]  "GET /dispatcher/invalidate.cache HTTP/1.1" 200 13 "about:blank" "Jakarta Commons-HttpClient/3.1"
```

Dispatcher - dispatcher.log<br>

```
[ 07/Jun/2022:13:44:35 +0900]  "GET /dispatcher/invalidate.cache HTTP/1.1" 200 purge [ publish/-]  0ms
```

Publish - error.log<br>

```
07.06.2022 13:44:35.750 *INFO* [ sling-threadpool-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx-(apache-sling-job-thread-pool)-1-com_day_cq_replication_job_flush(com/day/cq/replication/job/flush)]  com.day.cq.replication.Agent.flush Sending GET request to http://localhost:80/dispatcher/invalidate.cache
...
07.06.2022 13:44:35.758 *INFO* [ sling-threadpool-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx-(apache-sling-job-thread-pool)-1-com_day_cq_replication_job_flush(com/day/cq/replication/job/flush)]  com.day.cq.replication.Agent.flush Replication (ACTIVATE) of /content/xx-xxxxxx/us/en/products successful.
```




<b>Cause</b>

Here are typical cases where the Dispatcher cache files are updated unexpectedly.
 <br>
<u>Case 1 - Frequent cache updates for unexpected contents</u>

Cache files are updated frequently, but the updated contents are not the target of the cache invalidation request.

In this case, the value of `/statfileslevel` in the Dispatcher configuration may be too low. Note that, commenting out `/statfileslevel` in dispatcher.any means "0" for this value.

When you have `/statfileslevel "0"` and publish content, all the cache files are invalidated regardless of the paths. The link in the AEM Dispatcher Guide below describes the detail:

[Configuring Dispatcher - Invalidating Files by Folder Level](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-dispatcher/using/configuring/dispatcher-configuration.html#invalidating-files-by-folder-level)
 <br>
<u>Case 2 - Cache invalidation requests from an undesired client</u>

The Dispatcher configuration may not have an appropriate restriction for cache invalidation requests. Check `/allowedClients` in `dispatcher.any.`
 <br>
<u>Case 3 - No cache invalidation requests</u>

The Dispatcher configuration may use time-based cache invalidation. In this case, `/enableTTL "1"` should exist in `dispatcher.any.`
