# Dispatcher cache files are updated unexpectedly | AEM

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
Experience Manager
<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
Sometimes Dispatcher cache files are updated at an unexpected time or frequency.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Upon publishing content, Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) sends a cache invalidation request (GET /dispatcher/invalidate.cache) to the Dispatcher. After that, when a request for the content comes to the Dispatcher, it updates its cache files.

Based on this behavior, look for a pattern by collecting the logs about the cache invalidation requests and the content requests.

Example logs for an invalidation request:
Dispatcher - access_log<br>

```
127.0.0.1 - - `[` 07/Jun/2022:13:44:35 +0900`]`  "GET /dispatcher/invalidate.cache HTTP/1.1" 200 13 "about:blank" "Jakarta Commons-HttpClient/3.1"
```

Dispatcher - dispatcher.log<br>

```
`[` 07/Jun/2022:13:44:35 +0900`]`  "GET /dispatcher/invalidate.cache HTTP/1.1" 200 purge `[` publish/-`]`  0ms
```

Publish - error.log<br>

```

```




<b>Cause</b>

Here are typical cases where the Dispatcher cache files are updated unexpectedly.
 <br>
<u>Case 1 - Frequent cache updates for unexpected contents</u>

Cache files are updated frequently, but the updated contents are not the target of the cache invalidation request.

In this case, the value of `/statfileslevel` in the Dispatcher configuration may be too low. Note that, commenting out `/statfileslevel` in dispatcher.any means "0" for this value.

When you have `/statfileslevel "0"` and publish content, all the cache files are invalidated regardless of the paths. The reference describes the detail.

 <br>
<u>Case 2 - Cache invalidation requests from an undesired client</u>

The Dispatcher configuration may not have an appropriate restriction for cache invalidation requests. Check `/allowedClients` in `dispatcher.any.`
 <br>
<u>Case 3 - No cache invalidation requests</u>

The Dispatcher configuration may use time-based cache invalidation. In this case, `/enableTTL "1"` should exist in `dispatcher.any.`
