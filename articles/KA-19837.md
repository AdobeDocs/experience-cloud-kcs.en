# Blocking public access to the publisher's default URL

## Description

One customer wants o to block the public access to their production publish URL - [https://publish-pxxxxx-eyyy.adobeaemcloud.com/](https://publish-pxxxxx-eyyy.adobeaemcloud.com/), for it to be accessible only via their custom domain name ([www.example.com](http://www.soapandglory.com/)). <br><br>As per the custom domain name setup, the DNS record for '[www.example.com](http://www.soapandglory.com/)' contains a CNAME entry of [https://publish-pxxxxx-eyyy.adobeaemcloud.com](https://publish-pxxxxx-eyyy.adobeaemcloud.com/) '. <br><br>They do not have a separate CDN and are using AEMs' Fastly CDN

## Resolution


In this scenario, you cannot block by a certain domain at the edge.
The workaround is to create a vhost in the dispatcher to match your default domain [https://publish-pxxxxx-eyyy.adobeaemcloud.com/](https://publish-pxxxxx-eyyy.adobeaemcloud.com/) and deny access for all requests in the vhost 1.

However, the [!UICONTROL /systemready] path should be allowed because that is Adobe's healthcheck.
