# Blocking public access to the publisher's default URL

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

One customer wants to block public access to their production publish URL - [https://publish-pxxxxx-eyyy.adobeaemcloud.com/](https://publish-pxxxxx-eyyy.adobeaemcloud.com/), to ensure that it is accessible only via their custom domain name ([www.example.com](http://www.soapandglory.com/)).
<br><br>As per the custom domain name setup, the DNS record for '[www.example.com](http://www.soapandglory.com/)' contains a CNAME entry of [https://publish-pxxxxx-eyyy.adobeaemcloud.com](https://publish-pxxxxx-eyyy.adobeaemcloud.com/) '. <br><br>They do not have a separate CDN and are using AEM's Fastly CDN.<br>

## Resolution {#resolution}


In this scenario, you cannot block by a certain domain at the edge. The workaround is to create a vhost in the dispatcher to match your default domain [https://publish-pxxxxx-eyyy.adobeaemcloud.com/](https://publish-pxxxxx-eyyy.adobeaemcloud.com/) and deny access for all requests in the vhost.

However, the `/systemready` path should be allowed because that is Adobe's healthcheck.
