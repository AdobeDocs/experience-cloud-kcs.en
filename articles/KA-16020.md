# ACS - Dynamic Report matrix for the delivery


Learn about the Campaign Standard issues where a report for a specific delivery in Adobe Campaign Standard (ACS) is saved.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environments</b>

- Campaign
- Campaign Standard




<b>Issue</b>

- When a report for a specific delivery in ACS is saved, it pulls metric details for all the campaigns sent from the ACS instance and not the one which was being displayed initially. Is this a bug? If yes, is it already raised with the ACS product team?


Is there a way to do the following in reports:

- Pull specific delivery names under the Delivery Statics table?
- Pull metric based on the number of deliveries used in a workflow by selecting the workflow name itself?
- Option to edit/modify/choose deliveries under the Delivery Statics table?

    



## Resolution {#resolution}


- Creating a custom report saves the look and feel of the workspace, like the dimensions being used or metrics being displayed. It wonâ€™t save the filters. This way, one report can be reused for multiple deliveries/filters. So, this is expected behavior.


Second point:



- Yes, you can drag and drop any delivery in the Delivery statistics table to see the numbers for it.
- Workflow information is not there in the reporting system, so this is not possible.
- You can drag and drop any delivery/other dimensions.
