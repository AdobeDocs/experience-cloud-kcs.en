# Adobe Campaign: Click data is getting registered for a user without any corresponding open record


Learn why click data is getting registered for a user without any corresponding open record

## Description {#description}


###  Environment

Campaign Classic



###  Issue/Symptoms

It has been reported that click data is sometimes registered without a corresponding open record in the tracking logs.


## Resolution {#resolution}


This happens when the recipient does not download the 1x1 tracking pixel image which is present in any HTML email. This is a common method of tracking opens across the industry and is not a Campaign specific problem.

The only way to resolve this is to ensure that images are downloaded.
