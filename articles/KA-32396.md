# Links in Experience Fragments exported to Adobe Target do not match mapped URLs on the live site | AEM 6.x

## Description

Links and image URLs in Experience Fragments which are exported to Adobe Target do not match the scheme, domain and path of those on the live site.  This causes issues on sites that use /etc/map or resolver mappings on the publish instances. 

This is tracked as an Adobe Product issue, CQ-4261775.

## Resolution

For now, as a workaround, it is recommended to implement a rewriter to rewrite the output from the author instance upon exporting to Target.

Sample code is [attached](https://adobe-ent.crm.dynamics.com/main.aspx?appid=c8f3a4cd-a068-e911-a957-000d3a34e00b&pagetype=entityrecord&etn=sharepointdocument&id=b96f0569-23d5-4fe1-ba19-6995cbf578d2).
