# Error when trying to modify an operator

## Description

Issue - When trying to modify an operator, the following error appears:<br>
"Une donnée n'existe pas ou vous n'avez pas accès aux données du détail"

Rough translation: "The data does not exist, or you do not have to right to view the data."

The issue seems even with Admin rights.


## Resolution


Check if you had previously modified the data schema of "Operator", and had added a column but had not updated the database structure. After updating the database structure, everything should work properly.
