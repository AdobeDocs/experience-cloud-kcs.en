# Error when trying to modify an operator

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign Classic
- Campaign Classic v7



<b>Issues/Symptoms</b>
When trying to modify an operator, the following error appears:

"Une donnée n'existe pas ou vous n'avez pas accès aux données du détail"

Rough translation: "The data does not exist, or you do not have to right to view the data."

The issue pertains even with Admin rights.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Check if you have previously modified the data schema of "Operator", and added a column but did not update the database structure. After updating the database structure, everything should work seamlessly.
