# How to include "Event Date" in YYYY_MM format in Web Analytic Parameters


This article explains how to include a web analytic parameter (`utm_source`) in links in a way that populates the event date in the YYYY_MM format.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Campaign Standard

### <b>Issue</b>

You would like to include a web analytic parameter (`utm_source`) in links that go to their website, where the value is the date the email was sent on, but in YYYY_MM format.

The purpose is to use the expression context in the brand `configuration.eventDate`.

However, this populates the date in a very long/wordy format and not in the YYYY_MM format.

Currently, the `utm_source` parameter is hardcoded (e.g. '2020_10'), and you have to get the tech ops team to update each month via support tickets. This is very time-consuming and is often not updated on time.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Use the below expression in `utm_source` to achieve the desired output:

`context.eventDate.getFullYear().toString()+'_'+(parseInt(context.eventDate.getMonth()+1).toString())`
