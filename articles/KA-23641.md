# Default Value Ingestion in Adobe Experience Platform


If you need to set a default value during ingestion in <b>Adobe Experience Platform (AEP)</b>, particularly for upsert operations, you must use explicit mappings in your data ingestion process.

How to apply a default value during ingestion in Adobe Experience Platform?


## Resolution {#resolution}


It's important to note that default values set in your schema are not stored during ingestion. They are applied by downstream services when data is read from the dataset.



If a default value is to be applied during ingestion, especially in the context of upsert operations, you must use explicit mappings in your data ingestion process.
Here is an example of how to apply a default value using explicit mapping:



<b>Example:</b>

`DECODE(fieldName, null, 'default_value', fieldName)`

This will set *default_value* when the `fieldName` is <b>null</b> during ingestion.
