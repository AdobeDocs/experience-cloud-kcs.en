# Cold Standby throws "DataStoreException Record does not exist" error

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Experience Manager

<b>Issue</b>
 Cold Standby with dedicated File Datastore throws warning on missing blob id similar to the error here:


```
*WARN* standby-run-1 org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.plugins.blob.datastore.DataStoreBlobStore Error occurred while loading bytes from steam while fetching for id f68a92b34779bbd194184251ec916370f3ebd301d6e32a8980aad070d57a1845#25522

java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.io.IOException: org.apache.jackrabbit.core.data.DataStoreException: Record f68a92b34779bbd194184251ec916370f3ebd301d6e32a8980aad070d57a1845 does not exist

    at org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.cache.CacheLIRS$Segment.load(CacheLIRS.java:1017) org.apache.jackrabbit.oak-core-spi:1.10.3

...

Caused by: org.apache.jackrabbit.core.data.DataStoreException: Record cabdc49c6562afe71da796b57c2d1a6a3495026dfafff4d1073f1935a2c49c20 does not exist

    at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.data.AbstractDataStore.getRecord(AbstractDataStore.java:59)
```


<b>Cause</b>
 This is just a warning, not an error.

It comes from the fact that the File Datastore has no way to verify if a binary exists locally, except by trying to load the blob id.
 If the id gets loaded, the logs don't show this warning.
 However, if it's not found, the standby knows that it has to sync it, so that's why you see this kind of warning in the logs.


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>
This is working as designed and doesn't indicate a problem with the File Datastore.

To confirm that the blob id is actually not missing, follow these steps:

1. For example, take your sample blob id that is showing as missing in the logs (For example: `cabdc49c6562afe71da796b57c2d1a6a3495026dfafff4d1073f1935a2c49c20`).
2. For this blob id in this example, the filesystem address should be: `ca/bd/c4/9c6562afe71da796b57c2d1a6a3495026dfafff4d1073f1935a2c49c20`.
3. Search the filesystem on the standby instance, and check if the named file is present in the File Datastore.
4. Within `/repository/datastore`, use the `list` (For example: `ls -ald`) command: `ls -ald ca/bd/c4/9c6562afe71da796b57c2d1a6a3495026dfafff4d1073f1935a2c49c20`.
5. You should be able to see the file and confirm that the blob id is actually not missing.
