# Target: Recommendation results on the basis of recommendation designs

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
Target


## Resolution {#resolution}


The recommendation engine prepares the number of Recs candidates based on the design. So for a design with three slots, the Recs algorithm will try to generate three design slots candidates.

So when the design changes, it will need to recalculate the number of candidates again. That's why you need to wait for the results again when you make changes to the design.
