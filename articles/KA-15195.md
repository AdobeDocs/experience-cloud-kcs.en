# Target - Recommendation results on the basis of recommendation designs

## Description


User has created a recommendation activity and after the criteria results is concluded, they decided to change the design of the recommendation carousel.

There are no changes in criteria still why do they need to wait for results to get ready, only for the design change?


## Resolution


The recommendation engine prepares the number of Recs candidates based on the design. So for a design with 3 slots, the Recs algorithm will try to generate  3 \* number of design slots candidates.

So when the design changes it will need to recalculate the no of candidates again, hence the reason that you need to wait for the results again when you make changes to the design
