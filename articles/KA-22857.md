# Change in the OOTB Schema service "Name" field


The *Name* field is changed in the <b>Out-of-the-box (OOTB) Schema</b> service to avoid opening some deliveries from the <b>Profile Event</b> list failing with an error: *resources<b>unreachable.*





## Description {#description}


### </b>Environment<b>

Campaign Standard



### </b>Issue/Symptoms<b>

There is a change in the *Name* field of the </b>Out-of-the-box Schema<b> service.


## Resolution {#resolution}


This change was done to avoid opening some deliveries from the </b>Profile Event <b>list failing with an error: *resources unreachable*.

It was noticed that the deliveries that can be displayed from the</b> Profile Event<b> list page have their delivery ID names starting with *DM*. 
 Therefore, for the deliveries having ID names not starting with *DM*(starting with a number), it will generate the error.

The </b>Datatype<b> has not changed. The data policy was added to restrain the service name starting with the number. It will work as earlier without any deletion/misalignment of all services.
