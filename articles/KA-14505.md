# Uploading Google feed shows unknown error

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Target

<b>Issue</b>
 When trying to upload Google Feed, it throws an "Unknown Error".


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>
Provide a xml with a separate line for a xml header.
Currently the feed file is a big 1-liner starting with `?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?`, and our code expects `?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?` to be in a separate line at the beginning of the file.
