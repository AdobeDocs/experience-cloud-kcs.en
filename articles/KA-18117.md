# Errors in error.log on both Author and Publish Instances during startup

## Description


<u><b>Issue/Symptoms</b></u>

Customer noticed several errors in error.log on both Author and Publish Instances:

<b>- Author `error.log`:</b>

```
*\*ERROR\*  aem-api-metrics FrameworkEvent ERROR (org.apache.felix.log.LogException: org.osgi.framework.ServiceException: ServiceFactory.getService() resulted in a cycle.)
<br>org.apache.felix.log.LogException: org.osgi.framework.ServiceException: ServiceFactory.getService() resulted in a cycle.*

```


<b>- Publisher `error.log`</b>

```
*\*ERROR\*  ROOT bundle org.apache.felix.scr:2.1.30 (32) Circular reference detected trying to get service com.adobe.cq.wcm.translation.impl.sync.LanguageCopySynchronizer*
```


<u><b>Environment</b></u>

- AEM as a Cloud Service - [!DNL Sites]



## Resolution


<u><b>Root Cause:</b></u>

Analyzing the error logs provided by the customer, it was noticed that at the time the errors appeared, the instances were still in "Startup" mode, not all bundles being started - e.g. *`"StartupListenerTracker Startup progress: 83% (bundles 489/587)"`* . Therefore, the errors occurred as not all bundles were started.

During a restart, or anything that causes a restart such as installing or reinstalling bundles or packages that trigger a re-register of OSGi bundles, this kind of exceptions can be common.



================================================================================

If the errors are noticed after an instance is fully started, all bundles being active, please open a ticket with Adobe Support for further investigations.
