# Errors in error.log on both Author & Publish Instances during startup


This article provides steps on how to solve the issue in error.log on both Author & Publish instances during startup by raising a ticket to Adobe Support.

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
 Experience Manager

<b>Issue</b>
 There were several noticed errors in *error.log* on both Author and Publish instances.

<b>- Author error.log:</b>

*\*ERROR\*  aem-api-metrics FrameworkEvent ERROR (org.apache.felix.log.LogException: org.osgi.framework.ServiceException: ServiceFactory.getService() resulted in a cycle.)
<br>org.apache.felix.log.LogException: org.osgi.framework.ServiceException: ServiceFactory.getService() resulted in a cycle.*



*\*ERROR\*  org.apache.sling.engine.impl.SlingHttpContext handleSecurity: AuthenticationSupport service missing. Cannot authenticate request.
<br>\*ERROR\*  org.apache.sling.engine.impl.SlingHttpContext handleSecurity: Possible reason is missing Repository service. Check AuthenticationSupport dependencies.*



<b>- Publisher error.log</b>

*\*ERROR\*  ROOT bundle org.apache.felix.scr:2.1.30 (32) Circular reference detected trying to get service `[` com.adobe.cq.wcm.translation.impl.sync.LanguageCopySynchronizer`]`*






## Resolution {#resolution}


Upon analyzing the error logs, it has been noticed that at the time the errors appeared, the instances were still in the <b>Startup mode</b>, not all bundles being started (For example: *StartupListenerTracker Startup progress: 83% (bundles 489/587)*).

Therefore the errors occurred as *"not all bundles were started".*

During a restart, or anything that causes a restart such as installing or reinstalling bundles or packages that trigger a re-register of OSGi bundles, these kind of exceptions are common.



================================================================================

If the errors are noticed after an instance is fully started while bundles are also active, a ticket with Adobe Support for further investigation would be advisable.
