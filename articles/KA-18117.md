# Errors in error.log on both Author and Publish Instances during startup

## Description {#description}

<b><u>Environment</u></b>
- Experience Manager

<br><br> <br><br><b><u>Issue/Symptoms</u></b>
Customer noticed several errors in error.log on both Author and Publish Instances:

<b>- Author error.log:</b>

*\*ERROR\*  aem-api-metrics FrameworkEvent ERROR (org.apache.felix.log.LogException: org.osgi.framework.ServiceException: ServiceFactory.getService() resulted in a cycle.)
<br>org.apache.felix.log.LogException: org.osgi.framework.ServiceException: ServiceFactory.getService() resulted in a cycle.*



*\*ERROR\*  org.apache.sling.engine.impl.SlingHttpContext handleSecurity: AuthenticationSupport service missing. Cannot authenticate request.
<br>\*ERROR\*  org.apache.sling.engine.impl.SlingHttpContext handleSecurity: Possible reason is missing Repository service. Check AuthenticationSupport dependencies.*



<b>- Publisher error.log</b>

*\*ERROR\*  ROOT bundle org.apache.felix.scr:2.1.30 (32) Circular reference detected trying to get service com.adobe.cq.wcm.translation.impl.sync.LanguageCopySynchronizer*






## Resolution {#resolution}


<u><b>Root Cause:</b></u>

Analyzing the error logs provided by the customer, it was noticed that at the time the errors appeared, the instances were still in "Startup" mode, not all bundles being started - e.g. *"StartupListenerTracker Startup progress: 83% (bundles 489/587)"* . Therefore, the errors occurred as not all bundles were started.

During a restart, or anything that causes a restart such as installing or reinstalling bundles or packages that trigger a re-register of OSGi bundles, these kind of exceptions are common.



================================================================================

If the errors are noticed after an instance is fully started, all bundles being active, please open a ticket with Adobe Support for further investigations.
