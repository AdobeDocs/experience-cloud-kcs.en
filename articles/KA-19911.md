# Dispatcher changes not reflected in INT environment

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
Experience Manager Cloud Manager


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
In order to allow access to Comma-Separated Values (CSV), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and Extensible Markup Language (XML) files on publisher, we make changes in `filters.any` for dispatcher module. Once it is deployed the changes are reflecting fine on Dev but not on INT.


## Resolution {#resolution}

In this case, make sure that the web tier configuration is added to the full stack code deployment pipeline.
