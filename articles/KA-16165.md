# New Dependency function does not work at times with success metrics

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
Target


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
The new Dependency function does not work when we select *Conversion* and *Clicked an element* or viewed a page as the Additional goal. It seems only to work on *mbox* based success metrics. 
 In the goals and metric section of Target, the Dependency function is active when opening the Advanced settings, but when selecting *Conversion*+ *Clicked an element,* it disappears. The Dependency link disappears as well, when we first specify the metric dependency for an additional goal metric and then subsequently specify how to measure the metric as *Conversion/Clicked an element.*


## Resolution


Currently, we do not have built-in support for the Visual Experience Composer (VEC) based metrics like the*click tracking*. This is the reason that we are not seeing the option of adding metric dependency for VEC based metrics.
