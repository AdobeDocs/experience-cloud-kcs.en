# The new Target Dependency function does not work with success metrics based on conversion/clicked an element

## Description


Why it is not working when I select Conversion and Clicked an element or Viewed a page as the Additional goal? It seems only to work on mbox based success metrics. 
 In the goals and metric session of Target, function Dependency is active when opening the Advanced settings, but when selecting Conversion + Clicked an element it disappears. The Dependency link also disappears when I first specify the metric dependency for an additional goal metrics and then subsequently specify how to measure the metric as Conversion/Clicked an element.


## Resolution


We currently do not have built-in support for VEC-based metrics like click tracking. This is the reason that we are not seeing the option of adding metric dependency for VEC based metrics.
