# The new Dependency function does not work at times with success metrics

## Description

<br>Environment<br><br>
Target
<br><br>Issue/Symptoms<br><br>
Why is the Dependency function not working when I select *Conversion* and *Clicked an element* or Viewed a page as the Additional goal? It seems only to work on *mbox* based success metrics. 
 In the goals and metric session of Target, the function is active when opening the Advanced settings, but when selecting *Conversion*+ *Clicked an element,* it disappears. The Dependency link also disappears, when I first specify the metric dependency for an additional goal metric and then subsequently specify how to measure the metric as *Conversion/Clicked an element.*


## Resolution


Currently, we do not have built-in support for the Visual Experience Composer (VEC) based metrics like the*click tracking*. This is the reason that we are not seeing the option of adding metric dependency for VEC based metrics.
