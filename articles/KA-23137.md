## Resolution {#resolution}


Review the typology rules definition used in your alert activity properties and recreate any typology rule that is not using the correct field type. For steps, refer to [Apply typology rules](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/orchestrating-campaigns/campaign-optimization/applying-rules.html) in Campaign Classic v7 Documentation.

### Cause

There is a typology rule that uses a custom field that was previously a string, but is now an integer in the database. To see details on this process, in the log activate `-verbose` for the `wfserver` module, and execute the workflow with the debugging option <b>Execute in the engine</b> selected. For steps on executing this workflow, refer to [Workflow properties `>`  Execution tab](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/automating-with-workflows/advanced-management/workflow-properties.html?lang=en#execution) in Campaign Classic v7 Documentation.
