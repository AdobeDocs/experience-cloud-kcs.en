# JavaScript code error: "allocation size overflow"


This article provides resolution to the issue where the JavaScript code under Campaign Classic shows as "allocation size overflow"

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Campaign Classic

### Issue/Symptoms

Allocation size overflow error in JavaScript

This is a type of memory issue where the memory allocated for each query in JavaScript trying to access the database goes beyond the limit set in the server configuration file.
<br><br>E.g.: When one executes a delivery to a LINE with 30 thousand recipients and call the post-processing to generate the file to LINE, the JavaScript code that reads the file to variables throws an error: *allocation size overflow*









## Resolution {#resolution}

This error can be resolved in two ways:<br>
1. Raise the memory allocated in the `serverConf.xml`:


```
<!-- Configuring the JavaScript interpreter
```


` `

`     maxMB :  Maximum size in megabytes before running the garbage collector Default: 64`

`     stackSizeKB :  Size of each stack chunk in kilo octets Default: 8 -->`

`<javaScript maxMB="512" stackSizeKB="8"`



/`>`



Note: For the Hosted server, the *Adobe TechOps* team would perform this task. For On-Premise, the concerned have to make the changes on their own.



*(<b>Tip: I</b><b>increasing JavaScript from 64MB to 512MB is needed for custom and complex reports on large tables</b>)*



2. Use`linecount=<no of records to retrieve``>`  or `noLineCount =true` when creating the query def.

It would look like `<queryDef schema=schemaName operation= Select lineCount= 100000 or noLineCount=true`

However, the above option may work for some counts only and not if the count goes beyond a specific value.
