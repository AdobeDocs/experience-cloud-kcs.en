# JavaScript code error: "allocation size overflow"

## Description

<br>Environment<br><br>
Campaign Classic
<br><br>Issue/Symptoms<br><br>
Allocation size overflow error in JavaScript

This is a type of memory issue where the memory allocated for each query in JavaScript trying to access the database goes beyond the limit set in the server configuration file.
<br><br>E.g.: When you execute delivery to LINE with 30K recipients and call the post-processing to generate the file to LINE, the JavaScript code that reads the file to variables throws an error: *allocation size overflow*









## Resolution

<b>How to resolve this error?</b>
This error can be resolved in two ways:

1. You can raise the memory allocated in the `serverConf.xml`:




```
!-- Configuring the JavaScript interpreter
```


` `

`     maxMB :  Maximum size in megabytes before running the garbage collector Default: 64`

`     stackSizeKB :  Size of each stack chunk in kilo octets Default: 8 --`

`javaScript maxMB="512" stackSizeKB="8"`



/



Note: For the Hosted server, the *Adobe TechOps* team would perform this task. For the On-Premise, clients have to make the changes on their own.



*(<b>Tip: I</b><b>increasing JavaScript from 64MB to 512MB is needed for custom and complex reports on large tables</b>)*



2. Use something like `linecount=no of records to retrieve` or `noLineCount =true` when creating the query def.

It would look like `queryDef schema=schemaName operation= Select lineCount= 100000 or noLineCount=true`

However, the above option may work for some counts only and not if the count goes beyond a specific value.
