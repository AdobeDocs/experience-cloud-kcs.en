# JavaScript code error: "allocation size overflow"


This article provides resolution to the issue where the JavaScript code under Campaign Classic shows as "allocation size overflow"

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Campaign Classic

### Issue/Symptoms

Allocation size overflow error in JavaScript

This is a type of memory issue where the memory allocated for each query in JavaScript trying to access the database goes beyond the limit set in the server configuration file.
<br><br>E.g.: When one executes a delivery to a LINE with 30 thousand recipients and call the post-processing to generate the file to LINE, the JavaScript code that reads the file to variables throws an error: *allocation size overflow*









## Resolution {#resolution}

This error can be resolved in two ways:<br>
- Raise the memory allocated in the serverConf.xml:





```
maxMB :  Maximum size in megabytes before running the garbage collector Default: 64     stackSizeKB :  Size of each stack chunk in kilo octets Default: 8 -->     <javaScript maxMB="512" stackSizeKB="8"
```

/`>` 


<b>*          Note: For the Hosted server, the Adobe TechOps team would perform this task. For On-Premise, the concerned have to make the changes on their own.</b>*



*(<b>Tip: I</b><b>increasing JavaScript from 64MB to 512MB is needed for custom and complex reports on large tables</b>)*



- Use `linecount=<no of records to retrieve> or noLineCount =true`, when creating the query def.


It would look like `<` `queryDef schema=schemaName operation= Select lineCount= 100000 or noLineCount=true`
                 However, the above option may work for some counts only and not if the count goes beyond a specific value.
