# Inbox rendering tab not visible after IR package installation

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
Campaign Classic
<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
Inbox rendering package installed and configured. Post configuration, the IR request is submitted, and the proof is sent. However, when the proof is opened, the IR tab to view the renderings is missing.


## Resolution


On checking the `nmsDelivery` form, it has the condition that the *Email Deliverability* *package is required* for the IR tab to be visible. To fix this, install the *Email Deliverability package.*
