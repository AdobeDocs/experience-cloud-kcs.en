# Adobe Experience Platform: meta:enum can not be empty

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b><br><br>Adobe Experience Platform (AEP)<br><br><br><b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
When attempting to update a field group an error appears:*Error at meta:enum of property ECID. The meta:enum can not be empty.*






## Resolution {#resolution}


As a workaround, locate the empty enum values, and then replace them:

1. Run the <b>List field groups</b> call from postman API collection which shows you all your field groups. Make sure to set the <b>CONTAINER_ID</b> to *Tenant*. For steps, refer to [List field groups](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-platform-apis/references/schema-registry/#tag/Field-groups/operation/listFieldGroups) in our developer documentation.
2. Search among the list of field groups and find any that contain `"meta:enum": {}`.
3. For each of your field groups, follow steps 4-6.
4. Run the <b>Retrieve a field group</b> call using the field group ID found in the list from step 2. For steps, refer to [Retrieve a field group](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-platform-apis/references/schema-registry/#tag/Field-groups/operation/retrieveFieldGroup) in our developer documentation.
5. Copy the whole response. An example of a field within the field group that has this issue:

    


    ```clike
    "Profile Number": { 
                        "title": "Profile Number",                                     
                        "description": "Profile Number",                                    
                        "type": "string",                                     
                        "meta:xdmType": "string",                                    
                        "required": ,                                    
                        "meta:enum": {}                               
                      },
    ```



    and remove any lines that have `"meta:enum": {}`

    

    Once the `"meta:enum": {} ` has been removed, it will look something like:

     

    ```clike
    "Profile Number": {
                        "title": "Profile Number",
                        "description": "Profile Number",
                        "type": "string",
                        "meta:xdmType": "string",
                        "required": ,
                       },
    ```
6. Copy the response (that no longer has the `"meta:enum": {}`lines).
7. Run the <b>Update a custom field group</b> call and paste the entire edited response from step 6 and send. For steps, refer to [Update a custom field group](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-platform-apis/references/schema-registry/#tag/Field-groups/operation/patchFieldGroup) in our developer documentation.
8. This will update that specific field group to no longer receive the error. Repeat steps 4-7 for each of the field groups that have this error.


To learn about the collection that contains these calls, refer to [Postman collections](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/platform-apis/postman.html?lang=en#collections) in our Experience Platform Overview.
<b>Cause</b>
An update was made to the UI preventing customers from having empty enums.
