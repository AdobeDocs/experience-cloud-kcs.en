# Content not being unpublished from Preview after deletion on Author

## Description {#description}




If a page which has been previously published to both preview and publisher is deleted form the author without being first deactivated from the preview first, it will only be deleted from the publisher and not from the preview.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Created a page in Author.
2. Published the page to both preview and publisher or only on preview.
3. Then deleted the page form the author without deactivating the page from preview first.
4. The page is still present in preview





## Resolution {#resolution}


This is a known product limitation. If a page which has been previously published to preview is then deleted without deactivating it from preview first, it will not be deleted from preview.

This is traced under the internal Jira request - SITES-8226.
In order to avoid this situation please make sure you unpublish the content from the publisher before deleting it from the author.
