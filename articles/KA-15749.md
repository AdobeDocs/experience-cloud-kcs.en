# Adobe Campaign: Workflows including calculated XML fields error out on 9032

## Description


It has been found that post upgrade to 9032 that workflows leveraging calculated XML fields are failing with an "INSERT has more target columns than expressions".Â  Upon review of the SQL code being generated we can see that this is the case.


## Resolution


NEO-25194 has been entered with R&D and the fix has been confirmed for GS versions GS10 and up of 9032.
