# How setting the parameter "Maximum number of retries" to a higher value affect the processing time of deliveries

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign Classic



<b>Issues / Symptoms</b>
"Maximum number of retries" parameter in Delivery Properties

The default number of retries set for a delivery is 5. This means, in case of an undelivered message, the delivery will attempt to contact the address 5 times in the first day over the period of 24 hours. Second day on-wards, the delivery will give maximum 1 more attempt to deliver all the undelivered messages.

In case the value set in maximum number of retries is more than 5, there can be consequences resulting in slow performance in email execution.


## Resolution


Consequences

Slow Processing of deliveries

A delivery going into retry mode will always end up piling up records for `mtachild` to process.

Though the <b>Retry </b>option ensures that the mail is delivered to temporarily unavailable recipients, increasing the number of retries can hamper the entire processing speed of `mtachild.`

This may not only affect a single delivery but can also impact the processing of other deliveries since `mtachild` processes each delivery.



Hence, it is best to keep the value set to a maximum value of 5. This can be lowered as well.
