# Is adding "with SCHEMABINDING" to Scalar Functions supported for Campaign?

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign
- Classic



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
It has been found that clients using *SQL Server* can utilize the `with SCHEMABINDING` with the Scalar functions to improve performance.

The question however is whether or not this function is officially supported within Adobe Campaign.




## Resolution


At this time, `with SCHEMABINDING` isn't officially reported. That said, it does seem to work based on initial research. `NEO-19646` has been opened as an enhancement to fully support this functionality.
