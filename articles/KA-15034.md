# Is adding "with SCHEMABINDING" to Scalar Functions supported for Campaign?

## Description

<br>Environment<br><br>
- Campaign
- Classic



<br><br>Issue/Symptoms<br><br>
It has been found that clients using *SQL Server* can utilize the `with SCHEMABINDING` with the Scalar functions to improve performance.

The question however is whether or not this function is officially supported within Adobe Campaign.


## Resolution


At this time, `with SCHEMABINDING` isn't officially reported. That said, it does seem to work based on initial research. NEO-19646 has been opened as an enhancement to fully support this functionality.
