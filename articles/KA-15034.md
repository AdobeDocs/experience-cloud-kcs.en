# Adobe Campaign: Is adding "with SCHEMABINDING" to Scalar Functions supported for Campaign?

## Description


It has been found that clients using SQLServer can utilize the "with SCHEMABINDING" with the Scalar functions to improve performance.

The question however is whether or not this function is officially supported within Adobe Campaign.


## Resolution


At this time "with SCHEMABINDING" isn't officially reported. That said, it does seem to work based on initial research. NEO-19646 has been opened as an enhancement to fully support this functionality.
