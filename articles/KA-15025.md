# Value showing up in post_evar in Data Feed not populating in reports

## Description


On analyzing post processed column of an `evar` in [!UICONTROL Data Feeds], the values populate. However, the same values don't show upÂ in reporting in Adobe Analytics. Why?


## Resolution


If the evar is a merchandising evar with Product Variable syntax, the value of `evar` in `post_product` string will always take precedence over its value in `post_evar` column in the [!UICONTROL Data Feeds]. Consequently if the `evar` isn't populated as part of product syntax, the value in `post_evar` will be replaced with a null value.

This is why the values don't show up in reporting in Adobe Analytics.
