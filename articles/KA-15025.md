# Value showing up in post_evar in Data Feed not populating in reports

## Description

Environment<br>
- Customer Journey Analytics
- Analytics

<br> <br>Issues/symptoms<br>
On analyzing post processed column of an evar in Data Feeds, the values populate. However, the same values don't show up in reporting in Adobe Analytics. Why?




## Resolution


If the evar is a merchandising evar with Product Variable syntax, the value of evar in `post_product` string will always take precedence over its value in `post_evar` column in the Data Feed. Consequently if the evar isn't populated as part of product syntax, the value in `post_evar` will be replaced with a null value.

This is why the values don't show up in reporting in Adobe Analytics.
