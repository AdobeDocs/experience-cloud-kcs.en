# Value showing up in post_evar in Data Feed not populating in reports

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- Customer Journey Analytics
- Analytics



<b>Issues/symptoms</b>
On analyzing post processed column of an evar in Data Feeds, the values populate. However, the same values don't show upÂ in reporting in Adobe Analytics. Why?






## Resolution {#resolution}


In case of a merchandising evar with *Product Variable*syntax, the value of evar in `post_product` string will always take precedence over its value in `post_evar` column in the Data Feed. Consequently if the evar isn't populated as part of product syntax, the value in `post_evar` will be replaced with a null value.

This is why the values don't show up on Adobe Analytics reports.
