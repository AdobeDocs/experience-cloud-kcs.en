# Adobe Campaign: SMS tracking displays incorrect Opens


The article below explains recent improvements made to address confusion around tracking Opens and Clicks for SMS delivery reports in Adobe Campaign.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

- Adobe Campaign


- Adobe Campaign Classic




### Issue/Symptoms

When viewing delivery reports for SMS deliveries, the Opens statistics are incorrect.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Currently, there is an enhancement to have an option to hide or remove this field for SMS deliveries.

The enhancement reference can be found in the Adobe Campaign release notes under the reference NEO-75095 once the feature has been added.


<br>Cause:<br>
The statistics are incorrect because the Clicks are being registered as Opens as the current method of tracking Opens by including a 1x1 pixel image within the delivery is invalid for SMS messages since images cannot be included.

This logic can be confusing as it leads users to believe that Clicks are showing as subsequent Opens, which is not true, as recipients may have opened/read an SMS message but not clicked a link.
