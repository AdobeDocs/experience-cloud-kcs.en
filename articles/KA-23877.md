# Adobe Campaign: SMS tracking displays incorrect Opens


The article below details the logic and enhancement that has been logged to address confusion around the Opens and Clicks tracking for SMS delivery reports.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign (AC)

Adobe Campaign Classic (ACC)

### Issue

When viewing delivery reports for SMS deliveries, the Opens statistics are incorrect.

The reason for this is that Clicks are being registered as Opens as the current method of tracking Opens by including a 1x1 pixel image within the delivery is invalid for SMS messages since images cannot be included.

This logic has caused confusion as it leads users to believe that Clicks are showing as subsequent Opens, which is not true, as recipients may have opened/read an SMS message but not clicked a link.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Currently, there is an enhancement to have an option to hide or remove this field for SMS deliveries.

The enhancement reference is NEO-75095 and can be found within the Campaign release notes once the functionality has been added to Campaign.
