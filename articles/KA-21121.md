# New deployment is removing all styling | AEM


After the deployment of a pipeline on a specific environment in Adobe Experience Manager, it was noticed that custom styles were removed from a template, resulting in the loss of styles from the related page. Please remember to set the <b>filter</b> mode to *merge*.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

After deploying a pipeline on one environment, it was noticed that the custom styles from a template, and as a consequence, the styles from the page created with that template were removed.

## Resolution {#resolution}


When the project that the customer had deployed in their environment was reviewed, it was discovered that the `filter.xml` file under the branch that was in charge of changing the content—in this example, `[` 1`]`  —contained the filters `[` 2`]` .
The modified template after the deployment was located at `/conf/path>/settings/wcm/templates/modified template>`, but it had no filter mode, which by default indicates *replace*.
This implies that anytime a pipeline is deployed, the path in the code will be used instead.
This has to be fixed by setting the filter mode to *merge* like it is for the other paths `[` 3`]` .

`[` 1`]`


```
/aem-<cust>-project.all-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/jcr_root/apps/<cust>-packages/content/install/aem-<cust>-project.ui.content-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/META-INF/vault/filter.xml
```




`[` 2`]`




```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<workspaceFilter version="1.0">
    <filter root="/conf/<path>/settings/wcm/templates/<modified_template>"/>
    <filter root="/conf/<path>" mode="merge"/>
    <filter root="/conf/<path2>" mode="merge"/>
    <filter root="/content/<path2>" mode="merge"/>
    <filter root="/content/dam/<path2>/asset.jpg" mode="merge"/>
    <filter root="/content/experience-fragments/<path2>" mode="merge"/>
</workspaceFilter>
```




`[` 3`]`


```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<workspaceFilter version="1.0">
    <filter root="/conf/<path>/settings/wcm/templates/<modified_template>" mode="merge"/>
    <filter root="/conf/<path>" mode="merge"/>
    <filter root="/conf/<path2>" mode="merge"/>
    <filter root="/content/<path2>" mode="merge"/>
    <filter root="/content/dam/<path2>/asset.jpg" mode="merge"/>
    <filter root="/content/experience-fragments/<path2>" mode="merge"/>
</workspaceFilter>
```
