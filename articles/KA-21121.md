# New deployment is removing all styling

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
Experience Manager


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
After deploying a pipeline on one environment, the customer noticed that the custom styles from a template, and as a consequence, the styles from the page created with that template were removed.

## Resolution {#resolution}


When the project that the customer had deployed in their environment was reviewed, it was discovered that the `filter.xml` file under the branch that was in charge of changing the content—in this example, 1 —contained the filters 2.
The template that was modified after the deployment was located at `/conf/path/settings/wcm/templates/modified template`, but it had no filter mode, which by default indicates *replace*.
This implies that anytime a pipeline is deployed, the path in the code will be used instead.
This has to be fixed by setting the filter mode to *merge* like it is for the other paths 3.
