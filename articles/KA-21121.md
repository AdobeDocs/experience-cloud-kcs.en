# New deployment is removed all styling

## Description {#description}


After deploying a pipeline on one environment, the customer noticed that the custom styles from a template and as a consequence the styles from the page created with that template were removed.

## Resolution {#resolution}


Checking the project the customer deployed in their env it was noticed that the filter.xml file under the branch that was deployed had the content 1.
 The path "/conf/path/settings/wcm/templates/modified_template" which contains the template which is modified had the default filter mode, which means "replace".
 This means that whenever the customer is deploying a pipeline that path will be replaced with the one in the project deployed.
 In order to fix this the filter mode must be set to "merge" like for the other paths.


 1 workspaceFilter version="1.0"
 filter root="/conf/path/settings/wcm/templates/modified_template"/
 filter root="/conf/path" mode="merge"/
 filter root="/conf/path2" mode="merge"/
 filter root="/content/path2" mode="merge"/
 filter root="/content/dam/path2/asset.jpg" mode="merge"/
 filter root="/content/experience-fragments/path2" mode="merge"/
