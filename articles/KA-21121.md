# New deployment is removing all styling

## Description {#description}


After deploying a pipeline on one environment, the customer noticed that the custom styles from a template and as a consequence the styles from the page created with that template were removed.

## Resolution {#resolution}


When the project that the customer had deployed in their environment was reviewed, it was discovered that the filter.xml file under the branch that was in charge of changing the content—in this example, 1 —contained the filters 2.
The template that was modified after the deployment was located at "/conf/path/settings/wcm/templates/modified template," but it had no filter mode, which by default indicates "replace."
This implies that anytime a pipeline is deployed, the path in the code will be used instead.
This has to be fixed by setting the filter mode to "merge" like it is for the other paths 3.
