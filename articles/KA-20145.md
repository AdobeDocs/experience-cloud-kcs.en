# AEP - When updating an existing segment mapped to DV360, the updated segment name does not appear at DV360 - Why?

## Description {#description}

When updating an existing segment mapped to DV360, the updated segment name does not appear at DV360.

## Resolution {#resolution}


This is expected behavior. AEP does not propagate segment name changes to external partners yet.



*Note that for new segments being shared from AEP to DV360, the segment name appears at DV360 end. When updating a segment name in AEP, you may have to remove the segment from activation and then add it again with the new name.*
