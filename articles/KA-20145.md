# Updated segment name does not appear at DV360 | AEP


In Adobe Experience Platform, the updated segment name does not appear when mapped to <b>Display & Video 360 (DV360)</b>. Follow this article to resolve the issue.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Platform



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

When updating an existing segment mapped to <b>Display & Video 360 (DV360)</b>, the updated segment name does not appear at DV360.


## Resolution {#resolution}


This behavior is expected. However, AEP currently does not communicate changes in segment names with external partners.



Please note that when sharing new segments from AEP to DV360, the segment name will appear at the end of DV360. If someone needs to update a segment name in AEP, remove the segment from activation and then add it again with the new name.
