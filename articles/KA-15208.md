## Description {#description}


### Environment

### Issue/Symptoms

How to deal with personalization attribute and place holders for transactional messages when we are using AEM as the content source for email template?


## Resolution {#resolution}


In Message Center we use the <b>ctx</b> variable to personalize the deliveries.
  
 But, in AEM we don’t have the parameter to do the CTX declaration.
  
 Therefore, for transactional /Message Center deliveries, this is not achievable Out Of the Box.
  
 Therefore, as such, there is no way to import the AEM template for transactional deliveries because there is no provision for using the context variables.
