# BigQuery Error: Field iMessageType has changed type from INTEGER to BOOLEAN


In Adobe Campaign Classic, if you receive a BigQuery error when attempting to insert an INT8 bit data type from Adobe Campaign Classic to GCP BigQuery database, you should update the ODBC driver to the latest version.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Campaign


- Campaign Classic Hosted


- Campaign Classic On-premise




### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

When trying to insert a <b>INT8 Bit</b> data type from <b>Adobe Campaign Classic</b> to <b>GCP BigQuery Database</b>, an error occurs:


```
[ BigQuery]  Cloud SDK error: BigQuery error in load operation: Provided Schema does not match Table skyuk-uk- marketing-pres-dev:uk_pub_adobefda_is.wkf1385981793_44_1_0. Field iMessageType has changed type from INTEGER to BOOLEAN
```



There seems to be a problem in BigQuery with implicit conversions between integer and boolean data types.


## Resolution {#resolution}

<b>Solution:</b>
There are two ways to resolve this:

- For the older versions of <b>Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)</b>, this issue can be resolved by adding capability `retainNumericBoolean="true"` inside:

     

    <b>Administration</b> `>`  <b>Platform</b> `>`  <b>Options</b> `>`  <b>WdbcCapabilities_BigQuery</b>


- The update of the <b>ODBC</b> driver to the latest version can also fix this issue.

     

    The <b>Simba ODBC</b> driver made some changes with the boolean type.
