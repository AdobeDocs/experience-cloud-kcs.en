# Unexpected AAM UI access

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

- Audience Manager
- Customer Attributes
- Audience Library


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>



Users have access to the AAM UI, although they don't have specific AAM permissions


## Resolution {#resolution}


This is due to Customer Attributes & Audience Library permissions:

Audience Manager technology is leveraged in the back-end in order for Customer Attributes & Audience Library to properly function, therefore a limited set of AAM permissions are granted along with these permission sets. Therefore, if you do not want your users accessing the AAM UI, you will need to remove their Audience Library & Customer Attributes permissions as well.
