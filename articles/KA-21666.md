# How to grant access permission to Data Warehouse

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b><br><br>Analytics<br><br>

<b>Issues/Symptoms</b><br><br>Once the *Custom Data Warehouse Report* permission is granted to the product profile, the user assigned in the product profile cannot access Data Warehouse. Which permission should be added to grant access permission to Data Warehouse?<br>

## Resolution {#resolution}


Product profile permissions for Report Suite, including *Custom Data Warehouse Report*, are report suite level permission. Hence, the report suite IDs should be granted to the same product profile with "Custom Data Warehouse Report" permission.

For more details on product profile permission please refer to [Product profile permissions for report suite tools](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/admin-console/permissions/report-suite-tools.html?lang=en).
