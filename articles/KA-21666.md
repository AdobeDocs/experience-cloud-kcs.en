# How to grant access permission to Data Warehouse


In Adobe Analytics, if you have been granted access to Custom Data Warehouse Report permission through your product profile, you are still unable to access Data Warehouse. To grant the necessary access, you should have your assigned product profiles given report suite IDs with "Custom Data Warehouse Report" permissions as well.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Analytics

### <b>Issues/Symptoms</b>

Once the *Custom Data Warehouse Report* permission is granted to the product profile, the user assigned in the product profile cannot access Data Warehouse. Which permission should be added to grant access permission to Data Warehouse?


## Resolution {#resolution}


Product profile permissions for Report Suite, including *Custom Data Warehouse Report*, are report suite level permission. Hence, the report suite IDs should be granted to the same product profile with "Custom Data Warehouse Report" permission.

For more details on product profile permission please refer to [Product profile permissions for report suite tools](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/admin-console/permissions/report-suite-tools.html?lang=en).
