## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b><br><br>Analytics<br><br> <br><br> <br><br><b>Issues/Symptoms</b><br><br>Once the "Custom Data Warehouse Report" permission is granted to the product profile, the user assigned in the product profile cannot access Data Warehouse. Which permission should be added to grant access permission to Data Warehouse?<br>
