# Adobe Campaign Delivery Analysis start and end dates not updating correctly for recurring and continuous deliveries

## Description

It has been reported in Campaign that with recurring and continuous deliveries that the analysis start and end date are not filled out until the delivery has finished.

This is due to the nature of these deliveries as they are constantly re-running/re-analyzing.

## Resolution

Currently the only option is to use other filtering methods or to ensure that the capitalization in the advanced query matches the record being looked for.Â  Additionally NEO-23240 has been created to address this in future releases.
