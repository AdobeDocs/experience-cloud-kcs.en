# Inbox rendering functionality/button not available in the delivery form


If you don't see the <b>Inbox rendering </b>button in the delivery form, check for conflicts within the Campaign-Client interface. Resolve these conflicts manually and check that the required delivery form conditions are met for the feature to be visible again.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Classic (Version 7, Build 9346)

### Issue/Symptoms

The <b>Inbox rendering</b> functionality is not available in the delivery form, even though the inbox rendering package has been installed successfully.




## Resolution {#resolution}


#### Steps to reproduce

1. In ACC, open a created delivery.
2. In the delivery window, the <b>Inbox Rendering</b> button is not visible.


Check for existing conflicts within the Campaign client interface. Go to <b>Administration, Click on</b> <b>Configuration</b> and then <b>Package Management. Select</b> <b>Edit Conflicts</b>.

Resolve the conflict manually (this does not just involve installing the new version).

Note that the <b>Inbox Rendering</b> feature is only visible under the following conditions:

- If the '*inboxRendering*' package is installed, and
- If the name of package is mentioned in the '*visibleIf*' condition of the form.


### Cause

The issue occurred because the <b>Inbox Rendering</b> menu was completely missing in the form definition.

In Build 9349, there are cases where the old "deliverability" URL is hardcoded to the condition. In such cases, the <b>Inbox rendering</b> button is declared as below:


```
<container applicableIf="HasPackage('nms:deliverability')" img="nms:xxxx.png"
                   label="Inbox Rendering" name="rendering" visibleIf="EV(@messageType, 'mail') and EV(@deliveryMode, 'external') == false">
          <input type="UrlViewer" urlExpr="'http://deliverability.neolane.net/dm/inboxRendering.jssp?did=' + Iif([ properties/@midRemoteId] !=0, [ properties/@midRemoteId] , @id) + '&cuid=' + getOption('DmRendering_cuid')"
                 urlMode="true"/>
</container>
```


### Solution

To resolve the issue, the delivery form definition should contain '*Inbox Rendering*' as below:


```
container applicableIf="HasPackage('nms:inboxRendering')" img="nms:xxxx.png"
```
