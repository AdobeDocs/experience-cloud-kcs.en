Using Javascript, you can use a code snippet like the example below:


```
targetPageParams = function() {

var cookieValue = document.cookie.replace(/(?:(?:|.*;\s*)COOKIENAME\s*\=\s*(`[` ;`]` *).*$)|.*$/, "$1");

              return "PARAMNAME="+cookieValue;

        };

/* replace `COOKIENAME` and `PARAMNAME` */
```
