# Can a Target Audience be created based on cookie value?

## Description


Can a Target Audience be created based on cookie value? It seems by default [!DNL Adobe Target] is not able to do this.


## Resolution


There is no option in [!DNL Adobe Target] to create audience based on cookie value, but this can be done with help of Adobe Launch.

1.Go to [!UICONTROL data elements] in Adobe Launch

2.Add data element

3.Name : Element_Name

&#x200B;4. Extension : Core

&#x200B;5. Data Element Type : Cookie

&#x200B;6. Default Value : None

&#x200B;7. Check Clean Text

&#x200B;8. Storage Duration : Page view / Session / Visitor - As per your requirement

&#x200B;9. Cookie Name : Cookie_Name

&#x200B;10. Save Data element

&#x200B;11. Pass it in your global mbox

&#x200B;12. Name: any name to capture in [!DNL target]

&#x200B;13.Â [!UICONTROL Value] : Data element name that you created earlier



Then, go to Adobe Target.

1.Create Audience

2.Rule - Custom - Type Name (which is passed in mbox through launch) - follow your conditions



if you choose to use js, you can use a code snippet that looks something like this:

targetPageParams = function() &lbrace;

var cookieValue = document.cookie.replace(/(?:(?:|.\*;\s\*)COOKIENAME\s\*\=\s\*(;\*).\*$)|.\*$/, "$1");



return "PARAMNAME="+cookieValue;



&rbrace;;

/\* replace `COOKIENAME` and `PARAMNAME` \*/
