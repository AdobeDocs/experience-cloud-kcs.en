# Can a Target Audience be created based on cookie value?

## Description


Can a [!DNL Target] Audience be created based on cookie value? It seems by default Adobe Target is not able to do this.


## Resolution


There is no option in Adobe Target to create audience based on cookie value, but this can be done with help of Adobe Launch.

1. Go to data elements in Adobe Launch

2. Add data element

3. Name : Element_Name

4. Extension : Core

5. Data Element Type : Cookie

6. Default Value : None

7. Check Clean Text

8. Storage Duration : Page view / Session / Visitor - As per your requirement

9. Cookie Name : Cookie_Name

10. Save Data element

11. Pass it in your global mbox

12. Name: any name to capture in [!DNL Target]

13. [!UICONTROL Value] : Data element name that you created earlier



Then, go to Adobe Target.

1. Create [!UICONTROL Audience]

2. Rule - Custom - Type Name (which is passed in mbox through launch) - follow your conditions



if you choose to use js, you can use a code snippet that looks something like this:

```
targetPageParams = function() &lbrace;
var cookieValue = document.cookie.replace(/(?:(?:|.\*;\s\*)COOKIENAME\s\*\=\s\*(;\*).\*$)|.\*$/, "$1");
return "PARAMNAME="+cookieValue;
}
```

/\* replace `COOKIENAME` and `PARAMNAME` \*/
