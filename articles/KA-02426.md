# Handling failure associated with bulk asset update in AEM

## Description


<b>Affected products and versions</b>
AEM 6.x

<b>Issue</b>
When modifying a large number of assets at once, the process will fail to update some of the assets.

<b>Cause</b>
When reviewing the error log, a limitation appears to be reached based on the error messages similar to:

`18.05.2017 15:12:26.887 *WARN* qtp543692490-318999 org.apache.sling.engine.impl.parameters.Util Too many name/value pairs, stopped processing after 10000 entries`


## Resolution


The parameter <b>Maximum POST Parameters</b> that controls this can be found here:

`http://host:port/system/console/configMgr/org.apache.sling.engine.parameters`

When you do your `POST`, the number of assets you can update at any one time will be dependent on the number of properties that you need to update.

From a rough estimation and extrapolation of updating just a single property, a conservative update on a single property can be done on 100 assets at any one time.
