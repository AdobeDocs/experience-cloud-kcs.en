# Handling failure associated with bulk asset update in AEM

## Description


<b>Issue </b>
 When modifying a large number of assets at once, the process will fail to update some of the assets.
<b>Environment</b>
 AEM 6.x
<b>Cause </b>
 When reviewing the error log, it appears that we have reach some kind of limitation based on the messages like this 1.

 1 18.05.2017 15:12:26.887 \*WARN\* qtp543692490-318999 org.apache.sling.engine.impl.parameters.Util Too many name/value pairs, stopped processing after 10000 entries


## Resolution


The parameter "Maximum POST Parameters" that control this can be found here 1. When you do your POST, the number of assets you can update at any one time will be dependent on the number of property you need to update. From a rough estimation and extrapolation of updating just a single property, a conservative update on a single property can be done on 100 assets at any one time.
