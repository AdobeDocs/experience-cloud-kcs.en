## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Solution 1:</b> Check all the traits used by the segments in the model. There might be a possibility that the user would find a trait that is taken from Audience Marketplace, but a subscription for modeling is not enabled for the traits which are used in the model. In this case, the user would not be able to save the model. To save the model, remove all those traits or enable the subscription for modeling for these traits. Note that in case the user might want to enable the subscription for modeling, they might require to pay extra charges for that.



<b>Solution 2: </b>One of the possible ways to overcome this issue:

Check all the traits used by the segments in the model which the user wants to deactivate or delete. There might be a possibility that the user would find a trait that is not available. Check the below screenshot:

Remove all those traits which are not available, then try to deactivate or delete the model. Now, one might be able to successfully deactivate or delete the model.





*Note: When getting an error message in the UI, you may want to enable the Developer Tools when using Chrome and select the network tab, then try and replicate the above action again. The developer tools are likely to present more details, including the dependencies preventing you from completing your actions. This may help you understand the reason behind a UI error.*
