# Adobe Campaign: API 504 timeout errors


This article addresses the Adobe Campaign Classic issue whereÂ API calls to Campaign are resulting in 504 timeout errors. It is recommended that you increase the timeout from the default setting of 20 seconds.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Classic

### Issue/Symptoms

504 errors are showing up when making API calls to Campaign. Apache RequestReadTimeout option is set to 20 seconds (default setting).


## Resolution {#resolution}


Increase this timeout to match with the Amazon ELB (60 seconds) as some API calls can go over the default 20 seconds and time out.
