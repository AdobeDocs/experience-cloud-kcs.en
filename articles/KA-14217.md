# Adobe Campaign: API 504 timeout errors

## Description


It has been noted by some clients that 504 errors have been seen when making API calls to Campaign.




## Resolution


There could be multiple reasons for the call timeouts however one of the main reasons is that the Apache RequestReadTimeout option is set to 20 seconds by default.Â  It would be recommended to increase this timeout to match with the Amazon ELB (60 seconds) as some API calls can go over the default 20 seconds and time out.
