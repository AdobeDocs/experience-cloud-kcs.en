# Adobe Campaign: API 504 timeout errors

## Description {#description}




### Issue/Symptoms



- Receiving 504 errors when making API calls to Campaign






### Environment



- Apache RequestReadTimeout option is set to 20 seconds (default setting)



## Resolution {#resolution}




### Steps to Resolve/Workaround



- Increase this timeout to match with the Amazon ELB (60 seconds) as some API calls can go over the default 20 seconds and time out.
