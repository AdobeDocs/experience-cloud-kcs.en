# Adobe Campaign: API 504 timeout errors

## Description


It has been noted by some clients that 504 errors have been seen when making API calls to [!DNL Campaign].




## Resolution


There could be multiple reasons for the call timeouts however one of the main reasons is that the [!DNL Apache] `RequestReadTimeout` option is set to 20 seconds by default.Â  It would be recommended to increase this timeout to match with the [!DNL Amazon] ELB (60 seconds) as some API calls can go over the default 20 seconds and time out.
