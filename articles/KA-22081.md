# AEM: How to roll out a deleted Live Copy


Deleting a Live Copy page in Adobe Experience Manager without detaching it excludes the page from rollout. This article details the process of including the page in the rollout once more.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)
- AEM 6.5




### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Deleting a Live Copy page without detaching excludes it from rollout.


## Resolution {#resolution}


A root page of Live Copy has the following property ​​to exclude rollout.

<b>Node:</b> <b>{root of Live Copy Page}/jcr:content/cq:LiveSyncConfig
Properties: cq:excludedPaths (String`[` `]` )</b>

Deleting a Live Copy page without using the <b>Detach</b> option will result in the page name being added to a property, thereby excluding it from the rollout. Consequently, to include the deleted page in the rollout, one must remove the page name from the property.

<b>Example:</b>
If the following page on the *We-Retail* is deleted before Detach, then *men* is added to the <b>cq:excludedPaths </b>property value in Live Sync settings.
You can include the page in the rollout for the page by going to CRX/DE Lite and removing "men" from<b> cq:excludedPaths.</b>

Deleted page：<b>/content/we-retail/us/en/men </b>
Live Copy of root page：<b>/content/we-retail/us/en</b>
Live Sync settings：<b>/content/we-retail/us/en/jcr:content/cq:LiveSyncConfig</b>
