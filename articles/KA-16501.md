# In style system, when class name is part of preceding class name, the class name is not rendered


When a class name is part of a preceding class name, the class name is not rendered. To avoid this issue, it is recommended to use a Block Element Modifier (BEM) class naming convention. This ensures that each class name is unique and prevents any rendering issues.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

When a class name is part of a preceding class name, the class name is not rendered. For example, adding below styles to a text component policy:


```
Group name = Group
```


`Styles can be combined = check on Styles Style1 = cmp-text__class1 Style2 = class1`



Then the rendered HTML does not contain class1.


```
<div class="text cmp-text__class1 aem-GridColumn aem-GridColumn--default--12"> ... </div>
```


`For Style2 = class2, the rendered HTML contains class2.`


## Resolution {#resolution}


Since AEM 6.4, the current logic checks if a class name is part of a preceding class name. It is recommended to use a Block Element Modifier (BEM) class naming convention to ensure that every class name is unique.
