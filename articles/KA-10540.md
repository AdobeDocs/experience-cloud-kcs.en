# Renditions/thumbnails not generated for video files with special character in name in AEM

## Description


<b>Issue </b>
 When uploading video files, the thumbnails and renditions are not generated properly.

 Reviewing the error log, one would see something similar below:

 10.11.2016 21:16:16.870 \*ERROR\* JobHandler: /etc/workflow/instances/server0/2016-12-15_1/update_asset_509:/content/dam/myassets/Workplace&UpdateVideo_08202014.mp4/jcr:content/renditions/original com.day.cq.dam.s7dam.common.process.VideoProxyServiceProcess execute: error processing video /content/dam/myassets/Workplace&UpdateVideo_08202014.mp4 : encoding Processing status returned failed with Error due to Invalid encode request. 

<b>Environment</b>
 AEM 6.x

<b>Cause </b>
 The thumbnails and renditions are not generated properly because of special characters (e.g. '&') in the filename.
  
<b>Specified Message</b>


```
com.day.cq.dam.s7dam.common.process.VideoProxyServiceProcess execute: error processing video

encoding Processing status returned failed with
```



## Resolution


<b>Workaround</b>

The current workaround is to rename the file to avoid using special characters.
