# Rendering errors generate "unreachable" delivery failures


This article explains why you may experience the Javascript error "*unreachable*" when preparing deliveries in Campaign Standard.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Standard (ACS)

### Issue

While preparing deliveries, you may experience the Javascript error "`unreachable` `"`.

### Cause

The cause is a rendering error *variable not defined* that should have failed during delivery preparation.


## Resolution {#resolution}


This behavior is expected. This type of error (Javascript errors) can only be detected during the *message personalization* phase that occurs after delivery preparation (for example: before sending emails).

Please note that *message personalization* is driven by the MTA (mail transport agent) process. Due the Javascript error, the email is set as `unreachable` by the MTA.

The reason field shows why the email cannot be reached.
