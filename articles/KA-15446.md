# Rendering errors generate "unreachable" delivery failures

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Campaign Standard

<b>Issue</b>
 While preparing deliveries, you may experience the following Javascript error `unreachable`.

<b>Cause</b>
 The cause isÂ a rendering error `variable not defined` that should have failed during the delivery preparation.


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>
This behavior is expected. This type of error (Javascript errors) can only be detected during the message personalization phase that occurs after the delivery preparation (For example: before sending emails).

Please note that the message personalization is driven by the MTA (mail transport agent) process so due the Javascript error, the email is set as `unreachable` by the MTA.

The reason field shows why the email cannot be reached.
