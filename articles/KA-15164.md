# Campaign Classic: Batch Size option from the Update Data activity seems to be ignored

## Description


It has been reported that the <b>Batch Size</b> attribute from the update data workflow activity is not being respected.




## Resolution


According to the Campaign the documentation:

*The Batch size field lets you select the number of inbound transition elements to be updated. For example, if you state 500, the first 500 records dealt with will be updated.*

Instead, you should read the following:

The Batch size field lets you select the number of inbound transition elements to be updated per database transaction. For example, if you set 500 as batch size, then 500 records dealt with will be updated in a single database transaction.
