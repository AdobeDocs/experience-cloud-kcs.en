# Campaign Classic: [!UICONTROL Batch size] option from [!UICONTROL Update data] activity ignored

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
Campaign Classic


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
The *[!UICONTROL Batch size]* attribute from the update data workflow activity is not being respected.




## Resolution


The [!UICONTROL Batch size] field lets you select the number of inbound transition elements to be updated per database transaction. For example, if you set 500 as batch size, then 500 records dealt with will be updated in a single database transaction.
