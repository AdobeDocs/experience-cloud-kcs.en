# Campaign Classic: Batch Size option from the [!UICONTROL Update Data] activity seems to be ignored

## Description


It has been reported that the <b>Batch Size</b> attribute from the [!UICONTROL update data workflow] activity is not being respected.




## Resolution


According to the Campaign the documentation:

*The [!UICONTROL Batch size] field lets you select the number of inbound transition elements to be updated. For example, if you state 500, the first 500 records dealt with will be updated.*

Instead, you should read the following:

The [!UICONTROL Batch size] field lets you select the number of inbound transition elements to be updated per database transaction. For example, if you set [!UICONTROL 500] as [!UICONTROL batch size], then 500 records dealt with will be updated in a single database transaction.
