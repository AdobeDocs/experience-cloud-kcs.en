# Campaign Classic: Batch Size option from Update Data activity ignored


Learn why the Batch Size attribute from the update data workflow activity is not being respected.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Campaign Classic



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

The *Batch Size* attribute from the update data workflow activity is not being respected.




## Resolution {#resolution}


The Batch size field lets you select the number of inbound transition elements to be updated per database transaction. For example, if you set 500 as batch size, then 500 records dealt with will be updated in a single database transaction.
