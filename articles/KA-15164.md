# Campaign Classic: [!UICONTROL Batch size] option from the [!UICONTROL Update data] activity seems to be ignored

## Description


It has been reported that the <b>[!UICONTROL Batch size]</b> attribute from the <b>[!UICONTROL Update data]</b> workflow activity is not being respected.




## Resolution


According to the Campaign the documentation:

*The [!UICONTROL Batch size] field lets you select the number of inbound transition elements to be updated. For example, if you state 500, the first 500 records dealt with will be updated.*

Instead, you should read the following:

The [!UICONTROL Batch size] field lets you select the number of inbound transition elements to be updated per database transaction. For example, if you set 500 as [!UICONTROL Batch size], then 500 records dealt with will be updated in a single database transaction.
