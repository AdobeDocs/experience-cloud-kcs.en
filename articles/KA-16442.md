# Campaign Classic - Increase the number of campaign processes can run on the instance in parallel

## Description


We found that there are more and more chances that we encounter "Start as soon as possible" in campaigns due to the increasing number of campaigns to be launched.
We would like to seek your advice on increasing the "NmsOperation_LimitConcurrency " Options to meet our business needs.
Please help in advising if we increase this option limit could help in resolving this error that usually occurred during campaign execution.


## Resolution


In Campaign Standard, this setting is "hidden" in [!DNL serverConf.xml] now, capped at 20 by default  

In Campaign Classic the option [!UICONTROL NmsOperation_LimitConcurrency] is available and a value can be set. <u>This option applies to workflows created within campaigns ONLY.</u> However, setting a value that is too big is almost always catastrophic since customers usually are not aware of the h/w on the backend and whether their jobs will overload the DB.

A better idea is to use the workflow heatMap, in order to get some idea of how long jobs take to run, and avoid scheduling them all at the top of the hour (e.g. 8:00AM) as is often the case.

With better management and knowledge of workflow runtimes - through gaps - testing -
... and using HeatMap, customers can spread jobs out at 15min intervals in the hour or scatter them in different hours
... and utilize their hardware much better than just setting NmsOperation_LimitConcurrency  10 and "hoping for the best". This strategy simply won't work long term.





For on-premise customers who want to query this setting without going into the console, this is the SQL: (this assumes the latest build):

select sname, ilongvalue from xtkoption where sname like 'NmsOperation_LimitConcurrency%';
