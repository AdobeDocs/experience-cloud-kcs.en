# Does the Apply transformation option on destination activation normalize before hashing?

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

- Adobe Experience Platform (AEP)
- Real-time Customer Data Platform
- Customer Journey Analytics (CJA)




<b>Issue</b>

AEP - Does the ‘Apply transformation’ option on destination activation normalize (e.g. lower case) before hashing?


## Resolution {#resolution}


At this point in time (early 2023), destinations in AEP do not support general data normalization yet.

The <b>“apply transformation”</b> checkbox in destinations was built <u>specifically</u> for `SHA256` hashed emails.

We’d recommend customers normalize data/IDs upstream in their implementation (e.g. converting phone numbers into `E.164` format before ingestion, or using Data Prep to do lowercasing/hashing upon ingestion) so data can be cleansed and used in all downstream use cases, including activation.

We expect customers to use Data Prep during ingestion for such data quality operations.
