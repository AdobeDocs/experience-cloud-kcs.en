# Does the Apply transformation option on destination activation normalize before hashing?


We recommend customers normalize data/IDs upstream in their implementation (For example: converting phone numbers into `E.164` format before ingestion, or using Data Prep to do lowercasing/hashing upon ingestion) so data can be cleansed and used in all downstream use cases, including activation.

## Description {#description}


<b>Environments</b>

- Adobe Experience Platform (AEP)
- Real-time Customer Data Platform (RTCDP)
- Customer Journey Analytics (CJA)




<b>Issue</b>

AEP - Does the Apply transformation option on destination activation normalize (For example: lower case) before hashing?


## Resolution {#resolution}


As of early 2023, destinations in AEP don't support general data normalization.

The <b>apply transformation</b>Â checkbox in destinations was built <u>specifically</u> for `SHA256` hashed emails.

We recommend customers normalize data/IDs upstream in their implementation (For example: converting phone numbers into `E.164` format before ingestion, or using Data Prep to do lowercasing/hashing upon ingestion) so data can be cleansed and used in all downstream use cases, including activation.

We expect customers to use Data Prep during ingestion for such data quality operations.
