# Campaign process and periods within email addresses


As periods don't matter in Gmail addresses, the same rule is followed in Adobe Campaign as well.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environments</b>

- Adobe Campaign (AC)
- Adobe Campaign Standard (ACS)




### <b>Issue</b>

An interesting observation about Gmail addresses was discovered. See: [https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7436150?hl=en](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7436150?hl=en)
  
 From this link:
 For e.g., if your email is [johnsmith@gmail.com](mailto:johnsmith@gmail.com), you own all period versions of your address:

- [john.smith@gmail.com](mailto:john.smith@gmail.com)
- [jo.hn.sm.ith@gmail.com](mailto:jo.hn.sm.ith@gmail.com)
- [j.o.h.n.s.m.i.t.h@gmail.com](mailto:j.o.h.n.s.m.i.t.h@gmail.com)


How does Campaign handle period versions of email addresses?

Is there any out-of-the-box (OOTB) schema or workflow that helps distinguish accounts from period or non-period versions? Is it up to the customer to setup some sort of *Regular Expression (RegEx)* to capture the right account (If so, has anybody set something like this before)?


## Resolution {#resolution}


Adobe Campaign Standard (ACS) does not do special cases for email addresses internally. Periods are considered as normal characters and are never ignored, as this can be clearly a violation of the Request for Comments (RFC) standard.

As periods don't matter in Gmail addresses, the same rule is followed in Adobe Campaign as well.
