# [ACS] Dots in gmail addresses - Does [!DNL Campaign] handle this?

## Description


A customer has raised an interesting point about gmail addresses. See: [https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7436150?hl=en](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7436150?hl=en)
 
From this link:
For example, if your email is [johnsmith@gmail.com](mailto:johnsmith@gmail.com), you own all dotted versions of your address:

- [john.smith@gmail.com](mailto:john.smith@gmail.com)
- [jo.hn.sm.ith@gmail.com](mailto:jo.hn.sm.ith@gmail.com)
- [j.o.h.n.s.m.i.t.h@gmail.com](mailto:j.o.h.n.s.m.i.t.h@gmail.com)


We’d like to know if/how [!DNL Campaign] handles this. Is there something OOTB that helps distinguish accounts from dotted or non-dotted versions? Or is it up the customer to setup some sort of regex to capture the right account (if so, has anybody set something like this up before)?


## Resolution


ACS does not do special cases for email addresses internally. Dots are considered as normal characters and are never ignored, as this is clearly a violation of the RFC.

As dots don't matter in [!DNL Gmail] addresses, hence the same rule is followed on campaign side as well.
