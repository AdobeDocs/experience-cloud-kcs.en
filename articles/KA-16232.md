# How does Campaign process periods within email addresses?

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign
- Campaign Standard



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
A customer raised an interesting observation about Gmail addresses. See: [https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7436150?hl=en](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7436150?hl=en)
  
 From this link:
 For e.g., if your email is [johnsmith@gmail.com](mailto:johnsmith@gmail.com), you own all period versions of your address:

- [john.smith@gmail.com](mailto:john.smith@gmail.com)
- [jo.hn.sm.ith@gmail.com](mailto:jo.hn.sm.ith@gmail.com)
- [j.o.h.n.s.m.i.t.h@gmail.com](mailto:j.o.h.n.s.m.i.t.h@gmail.com)


How does Campaign handle period versions of email addresses? Is there any out-of-the-box (OOTB) schema or workflow that helps distinguish accounts from period or non-period versions? Is it up to the customer to setup some sort of *Regular Expression (RegEx)* to capture the right account (If so, has anybody set something like this before)?


## Resolution


*Adobe Campaign Standard (ACS)* does not do special cases for email addresses internally. Periods are considered as normal characters and are never ignored, as this can be clearly a violation of the Request for Comments (RFC) standard.

As periods don't matter in Gmail addresses, hence the same rule is followed in Adobe Campaign as well.
