# Mismatch in Entries and Exits between Data Warehouse and Report Builder

## Description

Difference in Entries and Exits between Data Warehouse and Report Builder

## Resolution


Due to the difference in the pipeline between Workspace and Report Builder, some variation is expected. When comparing Entries and Exits, the variation is huge. 
 This is an expected behavior based on how Entries and Exits are counted across these platforms in Adobe Analytics. The difference in calculation occurs when NONE is added to the dimension for which Entries and Exits are being reported. In the case of Report Builder, NONE is added before anything else in the Entries and Exits calculation whereas, in the Analysis Workspace, we add NONE after we calculate the Entries/Exits. This led to a huge difference in the count.
