# Performance analysis using built in profiler

## Description

<br>Symptoms<br><br>
Some process are really slow, but not blocking.  The server OS shows high CPU utilization from the AEM java process.
<br><br>Cause<br><br>
There are many possible causes for high CPU utilization, here are a few:

- Inefficient application code
- Traversal of large content structures
- High application memory utilization causing a lot of time spent in JVM Garbage Collection



## Resolution

Using the built-in CPU profiler<br><br>
A simple CPU profiling tool is included in AEM 6.x.

1. Open this URL: http://*aem-host:port*/system/console/profiler
2. Expand "Options"
3. Set the "Sample Interval (ms)" (or use the default)
4. Set the "Stack trace depth" (recommended value : at least 50)
5. Click "Start Collecting"
6. Wait 3-10 minutes to collect data while CPU utilization is high
7. Click "Stop" to collect the data (output is shown on the same page)


The profiler collects stack traces of running [threads](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/threads.html) (threads actively taking CPU time).  While collecting the stacks, it finds duplicate traces and sorts them from most common to least common.
