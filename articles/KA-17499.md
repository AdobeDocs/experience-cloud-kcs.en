# AEM - Java Performance troubleshooting using built in CPU profiler

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager (versions 6.4 and 6.5)

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Some server processes are really slow, but are not blocking.

The server OS shows high CPU utilization from the AEM java process.


## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Steps to Resolve</b>

A simple CPU profiling tool is included in AEM 6.x.

1. Open this URL: https://aem-host:port/system/console/profiler
2. Expand <b>Options</b>.
3. Set the <b>Sample Interval</b> (ms) or use the default.
4. Set the <b>Stack trace depth</b> (recommended value: at least 50).
5. Click <b>Start Collecting</b>.
6. Wait 3-10 minutes to collect data while CPU utilization is high.
7. Click <b>Stop</b> to collect the data (output is shown on the same page).


The profiler collects stack traces of running [threads](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/threads.html) (threads actively taking CPU time). While collecting the stacks, it finds duplicate traces and sorts them from most common to least common.
<b>Cause</b>
There are many possible causes for high CPU utilization. Here are a few:

- Inefficient application code
- Traversal of large content structures
- High application memory utilization causing a lot of time spent in JVM Garbage Collection
