In addition, the migration set cannot be deleted with the same error.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The migration set name contains a reserved OAK character (":").

The issue has been addressed to engineering via CQ-4353116.

Cloud Acceleration Manager has been modified by engineering to not allow reserved characters . / : `[`  `]`  | \* in the migration set name.
