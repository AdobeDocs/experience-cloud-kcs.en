# Not able to move experience fragments


When customers attempt to move a content fragment, sometimes the UI will spin, and the move operation will never complete.

## Description {#description}


Issue/Symptoms

- Not able to move experience fragments
- The "Move page..." status window popup spins and never completes
- The issue may be sporadic in nature - It can be successful when moving to some folders and not others
- The success seems to depend on the number of nodes in the destination folder





## Resolution {#resolution}


1. Browse to your [configuration manager](http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr) and edit the configuration for "Apache Sling Get Servlet". For cloud environments, you would need to edit the configuration "org.apache.sling.servlets.get.DefaultGetServlet"
2. Increase the value for "JSON Max Results". The count towards the JSON Limit is the number of all the children and grandchildren (resources) of the target folder. So if the target folder is /a/b/c then the count is all resources in /a/b/c and their children.
3. Clear your browser cache.
4. Retest the use case. A restart is not required.


As long as you keep your number of assets to 1000 per folder as recommended in the below documents, you should not have to increase the number to more than 3000 and you should not notice any performance issues with this configuration.
