# Album post containing two photos split into separate posts on [!DNL Facebook]

## Description

Album post containing two photos split into separate posts on [!DNL Facebook]

## Resolution


Album posts from [!DNL Social] appear as a single post of the album on [!DNL Facebook] when three or more photos are included in the album. In an album post which contains only two photos, the post always appears as two separate posts.

The split of the album into two posts is caused by a [!DNL Facebook] API limitation. [!DNL Facebook] does not provide an API to post an album. [!DNL Social] sends the individual photos and [!DNL Facebook] generates an auto-post (an aggregated album post) from the photos to create the album and aggregated album post.

[!DNL Social] moderation pulls the individual photo posts back into the system. In analytics reports, they appear as individual photos.

In summary, a [!DNL Facebook] album post of only two photos from [!DNL Social] never aggregates as an album on [!DNL Facebook]. You must have three or more photos in the [!DNL Social] post for it to work. Sometimes, [!DNL Facebook] may still break an intended album of three or more photos into separate posts by failing to aggregate them, but it is less likely.
