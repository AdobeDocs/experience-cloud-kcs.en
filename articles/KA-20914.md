# Can't find AEM project path on Cloud Configuration setup for Content Fragment


Rename the node in CRXDE, create a new one with the same name, and copy the properties over.

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)

<b>Issue</b>

1. Create a content fragment model under Tools / Assets successfully.
2. Go to Assets / Files / Project name / Created a fragment folder.
3. Inside the Fragment folder, try to create a Content Fragment and only the default fragment is showing (Simple Fragment).
4. Based on the AEM documentation, go one step back and select the folder.
5. Click Properties / Cloud services / Cloud configuration, upon the option to select the path.
6. You can see all the default projects like <b>WKND</b> or <b>we.retail</b>, but can't find the Project name to navigate to the model in order to create a Content Fragment.
7. Trying to modify the configuration was receives the following error:*java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Value for key jcr:title can't be put into node:*

## Resolution {#resolution}


Rename the node in CRXDE, create a new one with the same name, and copy the properties over.

<b>Cause</b>

The issue is that the node under `/conf` has the `jcr:primaryTyp `property set as *nt:folder*, instead of `sling:Folder`.
Because this node has the wrong type, it is not picked up by the configuration browser as a valid path.
