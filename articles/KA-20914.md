# Cannot find our AEM project path on Cloud Configuration setup for Content Fragment

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

- Adobe Experience Manager


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

1. Create a content fragment model under Tools / Assets successfully.
2. Go to Assets / Files / Project name / Created a fragment folder.
3. Inside the Fragment folder, try to create a Content Fragment and only the default fragment is showing (Simple Fragment).
4. Based on the AEM documentation, go one step back and select the folder.
5. Click Properties / Cloud services / Cloud configuration, upon the option to select the path.
6. You can see all the default projects like WKND or we.retail, but cannot find the Project name to navigate to the model in order to create a Content Fragment.
7. Trying to modify the configuration was getting the following error:*java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Value for key jcr:title can't be put into node:*

<br><br>(See the [Configurations and the Configuration Browser](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/administering/introduction/configurations.html?lang=en) in the Administering user guide)<br><br>![](assets/___05bdb936-a603-ee11-8f6e-6045bd006b4b___.png)<br>

## Resolution {#resolution}


Rename the node in CRXDE, create a new one with the same name and copy the properties over.

<b>Cause</b>

The issue is that the node under `/conf` has the `jcr:primaryTyp `property set as *nt:folder*, instead of `sling:Folder`.
Because this node has the wrong type, it is not picked up by the configuration browser as a valid path.
