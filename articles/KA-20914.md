# Cannot find our AEM project path on Cloud Configuration setup for Content Fragment

## Description


The customer created a content fragment model under tools  Assets successfully.

Under navigation, went to Assets  Files  Project name  Created a fragment folder.

 Inside the Fragment folder, tried to create a Content Fragment and only the default fragment was showing (Simple Fragment).

Based on the AEM documentation, went one step back and selected the folder and clicked properties  cloud services tab  cloud configuration, upon the option to select the path, can see all the default projects like WKND or we.retail but cannot find the Project name to navigate to the model in order to create a Content Fragment.


<br><br>Trying to modify the configuration was getting the following error: <b>java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Value for key jcr:title can't be put into node:</b><br><br> <br><br>0 [https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/administering/introduction/configurations.html?lang=en](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/administering/introduction/configurations.html?lang=en)<br><br> <br><br>![](assets/___2409f242-d659-ed11-9561-6045bd006e5a___.png)<br>

## Resolution


The behavior was reproduced locally by manually creating a folder in CRXDE.
The issue is that the node under /conf has the property jcr:primaryType set as nt:folder, instead of sling:Folder
Because this node has the wrong type, it is not picked up by the configuration browser as a valid path
One workaround would be to rename the node in CRXDE, create a new one with the same name and copy the properties over
