# Adobe Campaign: Delivery Analysis start and end dates not updating correctly for recurring and continuous deliveries

## Description


It has been reported in [!DNL Campaign] that with recurring and continuous deliveries that the analysis start and end date are not filled out until the delivery has finished.

This is due to the nature of these deliveries as they are constantly re-running/re-analyzing.


## Resolution


NEO-20755 was opened to address this issue and has since been fixed in builds 9228 or newer.
