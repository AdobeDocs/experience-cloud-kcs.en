# Team cannot access AEM Developer Console on all environments

## Description


The customer noticed that they cannot access the AEM developer console for all environments even though they have all permissions - Developer, Admin role, and Program manager

## Resolution


From the screenshot, it can be seen that the roles have been provided through a user group - "<b>Assigned by user_group_name user group</b>".
Nested groups are not supported in AEM as a Cloud Service.

Product permissions assigned via IMS user groups should be supported by AEM as a Cloud but IMS is not always reliable with inheritance and this is an issue already raised internally.



Therefore for the users to be able to access the Developer Console, pleaseÂ remove the roles from the user group and assign them directly to the users.
