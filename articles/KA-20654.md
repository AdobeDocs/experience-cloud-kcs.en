# Cannot access AEM Developer Console despite permissions


If your team cannot access the AEM Developer Console despite having required permissions, check if the roles were provided via a group. Remove the roles from the user group and assign them directly to the users.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Experience Manager

### Issue/Symptoms

You and your team members see a *Login failed Unable to log in* error when you attempt to log in to the AEM developer console for all environments, despite having the necessary permissions - Developer, Admin, and Program manager.

## Resolution {#resolution}


The administrator should check if the roles were provided through a user group. Go to Admin Console `>`  <b>Users</b>. If the roles were shared via a user group, you see <b>Assigned by `<` user_group_name`>`  user group</b>.

However, nested groups are not supported in AEM as a Cloud Service. Also, while product permissions assigned via IMS user groups should be supported by AEM as a Cloud Service, IMS is not always reliable with inheritance. The administrator should remove the roles from the user group and assign them directly to users.
