# Adobe I/O projects not available in Admin Console

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Analytics

<b>Issue</b>
 A project created via Adobe I/O is not showing up in Admin Console.


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>
There are 2 types of authentications that Adobe I/O console provides:
<br>1. *OAuth Integration:*
- It doesn't need to be linked to a product profile, because users have to login with their Adobe ID to access API via this authorization.
- So what kind of API, elements, metrics, etc., can a user access is totally based on user profile.

<br>2. *Service Based Integration:*
- This is particularly used by team or users like Dev team.


- Its authentication is done via public-private key.


- Its needs to be linked to a product profile. Why? Because users don't login to access API. They're to use a private key to to get the access token.
- So how would you decide the API access level where user is not logging in via his Adobe ID - that's where product profile come into picture.

   Whatever access is there in the profile, the same applies to the API.
