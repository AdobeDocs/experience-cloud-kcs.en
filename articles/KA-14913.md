# Service update based on Profile details page

## Description


Updating a service based on a specific flag in Profile details



E.g., there is a service named ABC opt-in, and on the Profile details page, there is a flag to mark/unmark the services available.

Is it possible to subscribe/unsubscribe from the service by setting the flag to true/false in the service checkbox on the Profile details page?
















## Resolution


<b>Resolution Details:</b>



Checking the service option on the Profile details page will not help update the subscription history.

This will only be possible if the receiver has clicked on the unsubscription/subscription link in the email received.
