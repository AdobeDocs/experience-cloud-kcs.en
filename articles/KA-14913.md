# Service subscription update on Profile details page

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Campaign Standard

### Issue/Symptoms

Updating a service based on a specific flag in Profile details



Case scenario: There is a service named ABC opt-in, and on the Profile details page, there is a flag to mark/unmark the services available.

Is it possible to *subscribe/unsubscribe* the service by setting the flag to true/false in the service checkbox on the Profile details page?
















## Resolution {#resolution}


Checking the service option on the Profile details page will not help update the subscription history.

This is only possible if the receiver has clicked on the *unsubscription/subscription* link in the email received.
