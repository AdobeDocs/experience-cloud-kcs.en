## Description {#description}


<b>Description</b> : Hello,

 we do not see share link or embed on production while using viewers tab. Please advise what is missing,


## Resolution {#resolution}


In order for the URL and Embed buttons tab to show up, the video itself needs to have been published. In addition to that, the Viewer Presets need to have been published as well. This is under AEM - hammer - Assets - Viewer Presets
