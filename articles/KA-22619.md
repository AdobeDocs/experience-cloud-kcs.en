# GraphQL API in AEMaaCS is not extensible

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Experience Manager

<b>Issue</b>
 GraphQL API in AEMaaCS is not extensible.


## Resolution {#resolution}


GraphQL API is currently not extensible. This is classified as a Feature/Improvement request.

The improvement request should mention the internal reference number, <b>SITES-15168</b>, in the request.

Improvement/Feature requests will have to go through the standard process and get accepted into the development roadmap.

This can be a lengthy process and depends heavily on the current business impact, so a clear timeline for implementation is currently not available.
