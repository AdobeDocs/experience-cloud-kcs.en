<b>Description</b> : IsÂ GraphQL API extensible in AEMaaCS?


## Resolution {#resolution}


GraphQL API is currently not extensible. This is classified as a Feature/Improvement request.



For this request the improvement request (internal reference number SITES-15168) was raised.

Improvement/Feature requests will have to go through the standard process and get accepted in the development roadmap. This can be a lengthy process and depends heavily on the current Business Impact, so a clear timeline for implementation is not available.
