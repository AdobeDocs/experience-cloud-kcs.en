# Additional parameters are not populating in app subscription RCP

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign
- Campaign Classic

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
We have extended the app subscription RCP table. When we try to insert values, with the key value pairs using additional parameters in the register device methods, only the device token and user key is getting updated. Can we know the reason to why is the data not populating?


## Resolution


Below provided screenshots illustrates that on adding the additional parameters in the *Services and Subscriptions* mobile App, one is able populate the email and phone number details.
