# Additional parameters are not populating in appsubscription Rcp ACC

## Description


We have extended app subscription Rcp table. When we try to insert values using key value pairs using additional parameters in register device methods, only deviceÂ  token and user key is updating. Kindly check on this and advice us that why data is not populating.


## Resolution


As we saw, that on adding the additional parameters in the "Services and Subscriptions" mobile App, we were able to populate the email and phone number details.
