# Additional parameters are not populating in app subscription RCP

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign
- Campaign Classic

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
We have extended the app subscription RCP table. When we try to insert values, with the key value pairs using additional parameters in the register device methods, only the device token and user key is updating. Kindly check this and advise us,Â why is the data not populating?


## Resolution


As we can see in the below provided screenshots, on adding the additional parameters in the *Services and Subscriptions* mobile App, we were able to populate the email and phone number details.
