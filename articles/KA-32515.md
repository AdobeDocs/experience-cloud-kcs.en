# Adobe Campaign Standard: Last Modified By listed as Anonymous

## Description

It has been noted that under many circumstances in ACS, the Last Modified By field shows up as Anonymous(Nobody) without any way to determine how the record got updated.

This is a limitation in the way that Campaign currently identifies records previously updated by deleted users, anonymous API requests, workflows, etc.

## Resolution

Currently there is an open enhancement request for this functionality to be added in a later release but it is not available at this time.

The reference is CAMP-42083
