# Mirror page link in delivery logs is not loading


If a mirror page link in the delivery logs is not loading, use *splitDeliveryEmail* set to default routing, and update the delivery template.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign

### Issue/Symptoms

After upgrading to Campaign V8, the following error is encountered with mirror pages for deliveries:


```
A technical error has occured: Bad mirror page; rc=400 
com.neolane.fwk.core.NlException: Bad mirror page; rc=400 at

org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:231)
```



## Resolution {#resolution}


An analysis shows that an 11.10 new setup is being implemented with the creation of a bunch of external accounts. It is an implementation for multi-cell mid setup.

Further, all the deliveries with a non-working mirror page are using the "*Email routing using MID sourcing tmg prod5*" routing.

To resolve this, use *splitDeliveryEmail* which should be set to default routing. Also, update the delivery template.

### Cause

The issue is caused by the usage of wrong routing for the mirror pages.
