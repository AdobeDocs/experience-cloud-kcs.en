# Mirror page link in delivery logs isn't loading


If a mirror page link in the delivery logs isn't loading, use `splitDeliveryEmail` set to default routing, and update the delivery template.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign v8 (AC v8)

### Issue

After upgrading to Campaign v8, the following error is encountered with mirror pages for deliveries:


```
A technical error has occurred: Bad mirror page; rc=400 
com.xxxxxxx.xxx.core.NlException: Bad mirror page; rc=400 at 
org.apache.jsp.m_jsp._jspService(m_jsp.java:180) at

javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service(HttpServlet.java:765) at 
org.apache.xxxxxxxx.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:231)
```



## Resolution {#resolution}


An analysis shows that an 11.10 new setup is being implemented with the creation of a bunch of external accounts. It's an implementation for multi-cell mid setup.

All the deliveries with a non-working mirror page are using the, "*Email routing using MID sourcing tmg prod5*" routing.

To resolve this, use `splitDeliveryEmail` which should be set to default routing. Also, update the delivery template.

### Cause

The issue is caused by the usage of wrong routing for the mirror pages.
