# Build Image Step Pipeline Failure


After updating the local SDK and making changes to the *`<`  aem-sdk-api`>`* in the *pom.xml file* at the project's root, you might encounter problems with the pipeline. The pipeline fails during the build image step. To resolve this issue, you must downgrade the *`<` aem-sdk-api`>`* to a previous version.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

After updating the local SDK and modifying the `<` aem-sdk-api`>`  of the `pom.xml` at the root of the project, you may experience issues with the pipeline.

During the build image step, the pipeline fails.

In the build logs, messages similar to `[` 1`]`  are present.

## Resolution {#resolution}


According to `[` 1`]` , the *`[` api-regions-exportsimports`]`* checks if all OSGI bundles have their Import-Package declarations satisfied by the Export-package declaration of other included bundles in the Maven project.

To troubleshoot, see if the bundle providing the package is included in the deployment. Alternatively, look at the manifest of the bundle that you would expect to be exporting to determine if the wrong name or wrong version was used.

However, in your case, the most plausible explanation for this could be that your AEM instance is still running the slightly outdated version `cq.wcm.core.components` bundle, which is exporting an older version of `com.adobe.cq.wcm.core.components.util` and `com.adobe.cq.wcm.core.components.models.`

But since the `aem-sdk-api` version has been updated in the code-base to a newer version, it references a newer version of those packages.

In order to fix this issue, downgrade `aem-sdk-api`to a previous version.
