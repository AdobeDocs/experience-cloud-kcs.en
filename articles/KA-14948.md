# Redirect all URLs from HTTP to HTTPS

## Description

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Environment<br><br>
- Campaign
- Campaign Classic

<br><br>Issue/Symptoms<br><br>
It has appeared, where some clients have run security audits and require all HTTP URLs to be redirected to *HTTPS*.Â  This is something that requires Tech-Ops to make changes to the application via the *backend config files.*

Due to the time consuming approval process for this change, it has been requested that this functionality should be a part of the front end application.


## Resolution


Currently, this requires a request to *Adobe Tech-Ops,* which may also require a review from a security engineer before the request can be completed.

Additionally, an enhancement in *NEO-19457* has been put forth for consideration in a later release.
