# Adobe Campaign: Redirect all URLs from HTTP to HTTPS

## Description


It has been seen where some clients have run security audits and require all HTTP URLs to be redirected to HTTPS.Â  This is something that requires Tech-Ops to make changes to the application via the backend config files.

Due to the time consuming approval process for this change, it has been requested that this functionality be a part of the front end application.


## Resolution


Currently this requires a request to Adobe Tech-Ops which may also require a review from a security engineer before the request can be completed.

Additionally an enhancement in NEO-19457 has been put forth for consideration in a later release.
