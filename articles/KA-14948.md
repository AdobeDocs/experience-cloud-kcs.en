# Redirect all URLs from HTTP to HTTPS


Learn how to redirect all URLs from *HTTP* to *HTTPS* by sending requests to *Adobe Tech-Ops.*

## Description {#description}


### Environment

- Campaign
- Campaign Classic


### Issue/Symptoms

It is noticed that security audits have been conducted and there is a need to require all HTTP URLs to *HTTPS*. This is something that requires Tech-Ops to make changes to the application via the *backend config files.*

Due to the time-consuming approval process for this change, it has been requested that this functionality should be a part of the front-end application.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Currently, this requires a request to *Adobe Tech-Ops,* which may also require a review from a security engineer before the request can be completed.
