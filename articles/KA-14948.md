# Redirect all URLs from HTTP to HTTPS


Learn how to redirect all URLs from *HTTP* to *HTTPS* by sending requests to *Adobe Tech-Ops.*

## Description {#description}


### Environment

- Campaign
- Campaign Classic


### Issue/Symptoms

It has appeared, where some clients have run security audits and require all HTTP URLs to be redirected to *HTTPS*.  This is something that requires Tech-Ops to make changes to the application via the *backend config files.*

Due to the time consuming approval process for this change, it has been requested that this functionality should be a part of the front end application.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Currently, this requires a request to *Adobe Tech-Ops,* which may also require a review from a security engineer before the request can be completed.

Additionally, an enhancement in *NEO-19457* has been put forth for consideration in a later release.
