# New classifications not showing up in the Classifications Hierarchy

## Description


In a scenario, new classifications created for a variable didn't show up in the classification structure in the report suite settings. What could be the possible reason for this behaviour?


## Resolution


The classification system allows 256 classifications on a variable. If a classification is created and deleted later, it would still count towards the limit of 256. That caters to the system of division numbers at the backend.

If the number of classifications created on a variable exceeds 256, the classifications won't be created and won't show up in the UI.
