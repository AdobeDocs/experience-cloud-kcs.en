# What is the way to implement this if I want to measure clicks on a link?

## Description

I would like to measure the number of clicks on the banners present on the page. What is the way to implement this?

## Resolution


As an example of implementation, it is possible to get the number of clicks by implementing custom link tracking. If this is implemented on the page, the s.tl() method will be called when a click is made, and the call will be sent and measured. The value will be stored in the dimension "Custom Link."

Example:
a href="example.html" onClick="s.tl(true,'o','Example link');"Click here/a

・Custom link

Note: There are multiple ways to implement, so please consider which implementation method is appropriate for your company. In addition, please use a development environment or a development report suite to thoroughly check whether the click values can be obtained as expected before it goes live.
