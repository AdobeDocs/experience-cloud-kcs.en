# Adobe Analytics: How to measure clicks on a banner

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- Adobe Analytics

<b>Issue/Symptoms </b><br>How to measure the number of clicks on the banners present on the page.

## Resolution {#resolution}


You can get the number of clicks by implementing custom link tracking. If it is implemented on the page, the `s.tl()` method will be called when a link is clicked, and the call is sent and measured. The value is stored in the "Custom Link." dimension.

Example:


```
a href="example.html" onClick="s.tl(true,'o','Example link');"Click here/a
```

Note: There are multiple implementation ways, so please consider which implementation method is appropriate for your company. In addition, please use a development environment or a development report suite to thoroughly check whether the click values can be obtained as expected before it goes live.
