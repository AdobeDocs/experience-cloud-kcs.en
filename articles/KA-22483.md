# Inconsistencies in data retrieval from ACS through Adobe Analytics

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Standard (ACS)

### Issue/Symptoms

You notice differences in the data retrieved in ACS and Adobe Analytics.

<b>Steps to reproduce</b>

1. Log in to ACS, and check the delivery dashboard.
2. Now, in Adobe Analytics, check if same values are fetched from ACS.



## Resolution {#resolution}


In ACS, `KpiSharing` and `kpiReconciliation` are the technical workflows that sync data between ACS and Analytics. Refer to this guide on [Technical workflows](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-standard/using/administrating/application-settings/technical-workflows.html?lang=en) for more information.

In this case, the following error is seen in the workflows:


```
19/06/2023 15:12:14 jsDataSource API call to Adobe Analytics failed - Url: https://api.omniture.com/admin/1.4/rest/?method=ReportSuite.GetTimeZone
Request body : {"rsid_list":[ "xxxxprod"] } Response: 400 Error: {"error":"Bad Request","error_description":"Access denied for some selected report suites.","error_uri":null}
19/06/2023 15:12:10 jsDataSource User name: userFirstName.LastName@domain.com:
```


It occurs because your user name (mentioned in the above error) no longer belongs to an active profile, but is still added to the external account <b>Share KPIs with Adobe Analytics (shareKPI)</b> as the Web Service User Name.

<b>Steps to resolve</b>

1. The user name in the external account needs to be changed to that of an active profile, which also has access to Analytics projects.
2. Go to <b>Administration</b> `>`  <b>Application settings</b> `>`  <b>External account</b>.
3. Choose <b>Share KPIs with Adobe Analytics (shareKPI)</b>, and change the Web Service User Name.
