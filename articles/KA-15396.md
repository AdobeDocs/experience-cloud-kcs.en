# Adobe Campaign Standard: Does Campaign use the new Litmus API?

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Campaign Standard

<b>Issue</b>
 In ACS, the Litmus preview renders slowly.

<b>Cause</b>
 ACS has been using the older preview API which is not as efficient as the latest API.


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>
Currently there is an enhancement in place (CAMP-41340) for the updated Litmus API to be used in a future release.
