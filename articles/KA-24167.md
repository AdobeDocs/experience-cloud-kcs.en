# In Control panel, production subdomains are listed under stage instance


This article provides steps to fix the issue where production subdomains are mistakenly displayed under the <b>stage instance</b> in the control panel of Adobe Campaign Classic.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Campaign Classic v7



### <b>Issues/Symptoms</b>

In the Control panel, under the<b> Subdomain Management</b> tab, when displaying the subdomains for the stage instance, one can notice that production subdomains are displayed.
<b>Steps to reproduce:</b>
1. Open the <b>Control panel</b> and go to the <b>Subdomain Management tab</b>.
2. Make sure the stage instance is selected. Observe that the displayed subdomains are not the stage ones, but the production ones.



## Resolution {#resolution}

Cause:<br>
This is because the production's mid or real-time instance has been added as an external account for the stage instance.


<br>Solution:<br>
Follow the below-mentioned steps:

1. Navigate to the Instance settings and select the <b>External Accounts tab</b>.
2. Select the stage instance from the drop-down list and check the external accounts displayed. If the above issue occurs, normally a production instance is listed. This shouldn't be the case since these should be only stage instances.
3. Disable or remove the production instance.
4. Select the production instance from the drop-down list and add the production instance you previously removed/disabled above.
