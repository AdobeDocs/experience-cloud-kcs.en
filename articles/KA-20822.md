# Performance tuning for S3 Datastore - Asynchronous mode

## Description


<u><b>Use-Case:</b></u>

Having an external S3 Datastore.

Performing lots of intensive <b>upload</b> activities:

- multiple and large assets ingestions
- importing large index definition (generated out-of-the-band)




By default, S3 uploads are *synchronous* and *mono-threaded*, therefore huge operations can take some time to perform


## Resolution


The documentation specifies, however, that S3 uploads can be configured to perform *asynchronously* and multi-threaded (10 threads by default):

[https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/deploying/deploying/data-store-config.html?lang=en#async-upload](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/deploying/deploying/data-store-config.html?lang=en#async-upload)



In order to greatly improve uploads time, it is possible to enable and test the asynchronous mode by adding a Java System parameter "*oak.lucene.ds.async*" to the startup command line:


```
-Doak.lucene.ds.async=true
```


To change the number of upload threads, you need to specify the *uploadThreads*parameter in your S3Datastore.config file.



These settings need to be tested first in a lower environment, performing some benchmarks, before pushing the change to production.
