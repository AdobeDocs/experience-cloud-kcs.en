# How can I set up S3/Azure destinations for Data Warehouse?

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
<br>Adobe Analytics
<br>Data Warehouse

## Resolution


<b>Resolution</b>
To set up, first create your report in Data Warehouse using an existing destination option, such as FTP.  Then reach out to Customer Support with the details of your report id and destination location.  Customer Support will work with the Data Warehouse team to set up and test your new report.

<b>Note</b>
Adobe is working on updates to the [!DNL Data Warehouse] API and UI to make this process easier in the future.
