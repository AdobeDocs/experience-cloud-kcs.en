# Block a member in Adobe Campaign Classic

## Description

One of my clients is in a situation where they need to block a specific user for becoming a member.
<br>Is there a checkbox or something that can solve this problem for them?<br><br>They are referring to a member/profile, not a user. They want to block a specific profile. Is that possible?
<br> 

## Resolution


There are two quick options that came to my mind depending on how they work:

- Mark the profile as “Do not contact on any channel” or any of those blacklist fields
- Add a typology rule to exclude specific profiles and/or email addresses.




You just update the do no longer contacted by fields, set them all to Yes….. The exclusion rules set at Delivery level would do the rest….. if they use Push, they should set the disabled flag to Yes for app application subscriptions for this person.
