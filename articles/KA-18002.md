# Block a member in Adobe Campaign Classic

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Campaign Classic
 Adobe Campaign

<b>Issue</b>
 What if a user is in a situation where they need to block a specific user for becoming a member?
 Is there a checkbox or something that can solve this problem for them?
 This refers to a member/profile, not a user. The objective is to block a specific profile. Is this possible to do?




## Resolution {#resolution}


There are two quick options depending on how they function:

- Mark the profile as “Do not contact on any channel” or any of those blacklist fields.
- Add a typology rule to exclude specific profiles and/or email addresses.




You just update the <b>do no longer contacted by</b> fields, set them all to *Yes*….. The exclusion rules set at Delivery level would do the rest….. if they use <b>Push</b>, they should set the <b>disabled flag</b> to *Yes* for app application subscriptions for this person.
