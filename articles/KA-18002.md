# Block a member in Adobe Campaign Classic


This article offers suggestions on how you can block a specific user in Campaign Classic from becoming a member. One way would be to mark the profile as “*Do not contact on any channel*”.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Campaign Classic

### <b>Issue</b>

How to block a specific user from becoming a member?

This refers to a member profile, not a user. The objective is to block a specific profile.




## Resolution {#resolution}


There are two quick options depending on how they function:

- Mark the profile as “*Do not contact on any channel*” or any of those blacklist fields.
- Add a typology rule to exclude specific profiles and/or email addresses.


You just update the <b>do no longer contacted by</b> fields, set them all to *Yes.* The exclusion rules set at *Delivery* level would do the rest. If they use <b>Push</b>, they should set the <b>disabled flag</b> to *Yes* for app application subscriptions for this person.
