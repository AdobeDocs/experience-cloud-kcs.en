My user ID (Federated ID,  Enterprise ID or Adobe ID) has System admin permission, but I couldn't see the "Edit user profile" menu of my User ID  in the Admin Console. How can I update my User ID name, "test01 guwu" in below image?<br><br>

## Resolution {#resolution}


ID Type: Federated ID or Enterprise ID or Adobe
Please ask another System Admin user in your Organization to update your ID profile. Other system administrators can access the "Edit User Profile" of your User ID through the Admin console.

ID Type: Business ID
The "Edit User Profile" option is not available for <b>Business ID</b> type users. This means, that these users will need to update their profiles [here](https://account.adobe.com/profile). For more, see how to [Update your account profile](https://helpx.adobe.com/manage-account/using/edit-adobe-account-personal-profile.html).
