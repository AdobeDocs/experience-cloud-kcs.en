# Audience Paramaters_Browser and/or Screen Widths not working

## Description


Scenario : I have created an experiment where I want to target only specific browser widths.

However, I am not seeing any traffic hitting my experiment.



I can see from using Adobe Analytics, that traffic did hit the page with this experiment that would have met the audience setting.


## Resolution


This is however a known functionality when using at.js 2.x as mentioned [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/implement-target/client-side/at-js-implementation/upgrading-from-atjs-1x-to-atjs-20.html?lang=en#:~:text=displayed%20and%20applied.-,Which%20at.js%201.x%20parameters%20for%20creating%20audiences%20are%20not%20supported%20in%20at.js%202.x%3F,-The%20following%20at)

Workaround : 
 The simplest way is to leverage window.targetPageParamsAll and add a piece of JavaScript right before at.js, something like:

window.targetPageParamsAll = function() {
   return {
      browserWidth: document.documentElement.clientWidth;
   };
