# Audience Parameters_Browser and/or Screen Widths not working

## Description

<br>Environment<br><br>
Target
<br><br>Issue/Symptoms<br><br>
<b>Scenario:</b> I have created an experiment, where I want to target only specific browser widths. However, I don't see any traffic hitting my experiment.

But, when I used the Adobe Analytics, traffic did hit the page with this experiment that would have met the audience setting.


## Resolution


This is a known functionality when using `at.js 2.x` as mentioned [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/implement-target/client-side/at-js-implementation/upgrading-from-atjs-1x-to-atjs-20.html?lang=en#:~:text=displayed%20and%20applied.-,Which%20at.js%201.x%20parameters%20for%20creating%20audiences%20are%20not%20supported%20in%20at.js%202.x%3F,-The%20following%20at)

<b>Workaround:</b> 
The simplest way is to leverage `window.targetPageParamsAll` and add a piece of JavaScript right before `at.js`, something like:




```
window.targetPageParamsAll = function () {
  return (
     browserWidth: document.documentElement.clientWidth;
 );
```


`}`
