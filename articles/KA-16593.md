# Audience Parameters_Browser and/or Screen Widths not working

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
Adobe Target


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
A user created an experiment where they wanted to target only specific browser widths. But they didn't see any traffic hitting the experiment.

However, when using Adobe Analytics, user saw that traffic did hit the page with this experiment that would have met the audience setting.


## Resolution {#resolution}


This is a known functionality when using `at.js 2.x` as mentioned [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target-dev/developer/client-side/at-js-implementation/upgrading-from-atjs-1x-to-atjs-20.html).

<b>Workaround:</b>

The simplest way is to leverage `window.targetPageParamsAll` and add a piece of JavaScript right before `at.js`, such as:


```
window.targetPageParamsAll = function () {

  return (

     browserWidth: document.documentElement.clientWidth;

 );

}
```
