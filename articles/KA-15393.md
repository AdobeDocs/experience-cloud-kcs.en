# "Update shared audience" Issues running workflow to Export Audiences


The workflow to export audiences from Adobe Campaign to Adobe Audience Manager using <b>Update shared audience</b> fails possibly because of the digest function being used directly without the table name.

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

- Adobe Campaign Classic
- Adobe Campaign


<b>Issue</b>
 When integrating Adobe Campaign (AC) and Audience Manager (AAM) and running workflow to export audiences from AC to AAM using <b>Update shared audience</b> activity, the workflow fails with an error similar to this:


```
exportToAAM    XTK-170016 You are not authorized to use SQL expressions. 'digest' cannot be processed.
```



## Resolution {#resolution}


This error often occurs when there is encryption set at AMC-datasource, or the encrypted-Identifier is using a reconciliation key.

Check the AMC-datasource and make sure to check the encryption (setting it to *none* sometimes helps). Note that the encrypted-Identifier cannot be used as a reconciliation key.

The problem may come from the fact that the digest function is being used directly without the table name. Ideally the function should be referred to as `nmsrecipient.digest()` instead of `digest()` directly.

The same solution has been provided in a Microsoft forum post: [Execution error: 'the function name is not a recognized built-in function name'](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/66a6e3db-3ec6-4214-9d2f-a6a532a37db5/execution-error-the-function-name-is-not-a-recognized-builtin-function-name?forum=sqldatabaseengine).

To resolve this, you need to select encryption method to *none* in the AMC data sources folder under <b>Administration</b> `>`  <b>Platform</b> as mentioned above.
