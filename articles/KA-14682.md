# Publishing of references broken on Touch UI

## Description

In AEM 6.5, when peforming a "Quick Publish" of an asset with new tags added, the UI hangs in loading state on the [!UICONTROL publish references] screen with this error in the javascript console:


Uncaught DOMException: Blocked a frame with origin "https://x.x.x.x" from accessing a cross-origin frame.
at JSON.stringify (anonymous)



## Resolution

This issue will be fixed in a later AEM release.  For now to resolve the issue, disable "Aggregate Usage Tracking"

1. Login to AEM as admin
2. Go to http://aemhost:port/system/console/configMgr/com.adobe.cq.experiencelog.ExperienceLogConfig
3. Uncheck Enabled
4. Click [!UICONTROL Save]
