# FFMpeg indentation mismatch between AEM and FFMpeg


As part of the DAM asset processing functionality, every author instance has been provided with an installed copy of the FFmpeg CLI tool. However, a known issue with regular expression matching requires the upcoming Service Pack 14 for resolution.

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager 6.5

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

As part of the DAM asset processing functionality, every author instance has been provided with an installed copy of the FFmpeg CLI tool. This is to be used with inbuilt `com.day.cq.dam.handler.ffmpeg.FFMpegWrapper` class (OOTB Day Communique 5 DAM Video Extensions bundle i.e. `com.day.cq.dam.cq-dam-video`) to generate new video renditions, which start with a call to determine the input asset size.

The problem arises when it tries to match CLI output to a specific regular expression:


```
"    Stream.* Video: .*


d+xd+.*"
```


i.e. one where there are exactly FOUR spaces before *Stream*.

However, the ffmpeg 4.4-static that has been provided on the instance (which is the current version) outputs TWO spaces in the line this regex is looking for:


```
Stream #0:0(und): Video: vp9, yuv420p(tv, bt709, progressive), 560x320, q=2-31, 30 fps, 1k tbn (default)
```


Thus AEM FFMpegWrapper (`cq-dam-video 5.12.8`) fails to obtain the necessary details and the transcoding process does not even start, thereby breaking the workflow.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Wait for and apply Service Pack 14.
