# FFMpeg indentation mismatch between AEM and FFMpeg

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager 6.5

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

As part of the DAM asset processing functionality, every author instance has been provided with an installed copy of the FFmpeg CLI tool. This is to be used with inbuilt `com.day.cq.dam.handler.ffmpeg.FFMpegWrapper` class (OOTB Day Communique 5 DAM Video Extensions bundle i.e. `com.day.cq.dam.cq-dam-video`) to generate new video renditions, which start with a call to determine the input asset size.

The problem arises when it tries to match CLI output to a specific regular expression:


```
"    Stream.* Video: .*
d+xd+.*"
```


i.e. one where there are exactly FOUR spaces before "Stream".

However the ffmpeg 4.4-static that has been provided on the instance (which is the current version) outputs TWO spaces in the line this regex is looking for:


```
Stream #0:0(und): Video: vp9, yuv420p(tv, bt709, progressive), 560x320, q=2-31, 30 fps, 1k tbn (default)
```


Thus AEM FFMpegWrapper (`cq-dam-video 5.12.8`) fails to obtain the necessary details and the transcoding process does not even start, thereby breaking the workflow.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Wait for and apply Service Pack 14.
