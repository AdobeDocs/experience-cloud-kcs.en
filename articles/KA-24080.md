# Adobe Experience Manager: The first investigation step for "No renderer for extension html"

<br> <br>
## Description {#description}

You might encounter an error message with "No renderer for extension html". This article explains the first point to check when such an error occurs.<br><br> <br><br><b>Environments</b>
<br>AEM as a Cloud Service, AEM 6.5
<br> 

## Resolution {#resolution}

The error message 'No renderer for extension html' indicates that AEM is unable to locate the appropriate script or program to render HTML. This can cause parts of the page or the entire page to fail to display. <br>Example:<br>01.01.2024 12:34:56.789 *\*ERROR\* * `[` 192.168.0.123 `[` 0000000000000`]`  GET /content/wknd/us/en/testpage01.html HTTP/1.1`]`  org.apache.sling.servlets.get.impl.DefaultGetServlet No renderer for extension html, cannot render resource TemplatedResourceImpl, type=wknd/components/missing, path=/content/wknd/us/en/testpage01/jcr:content/root/container/text <br>In the given example, the error suggests that when the page /content/wknd/us/en/testpage01.html is accessed, certain components of the page cannot be rendered. Specifically, the resource "wknd/components/missing", which is sling:resourceType of the component at "jcr:content/root/container/text" on testpage01, is not found in AEM. Consequently, this results in the component being absent from the page. <br>The initial step to address this error is to confirm the existence of the resource, as indicated by the type wknd/components/missing in the example, within AEM.
