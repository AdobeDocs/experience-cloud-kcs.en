# prodView event not attributed automatically when product is fired

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Analytics

<b>Issue</b>
 The default logic states that the <b>prodView</b> event is added automatically to the Hit in case there is a product passed without any events.

In some cases, the <b>prodView</b> event isn't added. What is the reason?


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>

The system will auto-add a product view event to the `event_list` after processing rules have executed if there is a product in the `product_list` and the `event_list` is empty (or has only instance events for evars/revars/campaign/etc.).

So if there are any custom events, revents, purchase event, shopping cart events, etc. in the `event_list` after processing rules have executed, then it will <u><em><b>not </b></em></u>auto-add the product view event if there is a product in the `product_list`.
