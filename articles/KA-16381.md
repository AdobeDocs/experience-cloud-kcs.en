# prodView event not attributed automatically when product is fired

## Description


The default logic states that the [!UICONTROL prodView] event is added automatically to the Hit in case there is a product passed without any events. In some cases, the prodView event isn't added. What is the reason?


## Resolution


The system will auto add a product view event to the event_list after processing rules have executed if there is a product in the product_list and the event_list is empty (or has only instance events for evars/revars/campaign/etc.). Â So if there are any custom events, revents, purchase event, shopping cart events, etc. in the event_list after processing rules have executed then it will <u><em><b>not </b></em></u>auto add the product view event if there is a product in the product_list.
