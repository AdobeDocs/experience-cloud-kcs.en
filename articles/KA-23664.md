# Adobe Experience Manager: The node with "sling:resourceType=wcm/msm/components/ghost"

## Description {#description}


In some cases, nodes with a sling:resourceType value of wcm/msm/components/ghost exist. This article explains how the node is created.

<b>Environments</b>

AEM as a Cloud Service, AEM 6.5


## Resolution {#resolution}


The node is created as part of the MSM (Multi Site Manager) functionality. The node will be used to restore a deleted component in the live copy. The node is left behind instead of being completely removed.

The following actions will change the sling:resourceType of a component's node to wcm/msm/components/ghost:

Step 1. Cancel Inheritance of a component on the live copied page
Step 2. Delete the component
Step 3. The sling:resourceType of the node of the deleted component becomes wcm/msm/components/ghost

The deleted component is displayed as a Placeholder for a deleted inherited Component in the page editor. Re-enable Inheritance will revert the component, including the sling:resourceType, to the state before inheritance is canceled.
