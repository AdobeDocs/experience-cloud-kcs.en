# Campaign Standard: How to implement page anchors


In this article, you will learn how to implement page anchors in Adobe Campaign Standard using the HTML content component from *Email Designer*.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Campaign Standard

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

A request has been submitted to implement an internal link type to create page anchors, also called *jumping links*.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Anchors can be implemented by using the HTML content component from the Email Designer.

Please consider the following example:

You can add the following HTML to the first HTML content component:
`<a href="#C4">Jump to chapter 4</a>`

And the second HTML content component will have:
`<a name="C4">Chapter 4</a>`

Lastly, the following line has to be commented out:
`<meta class="nl-dce-fragment" data-nl-name="EmailUrlBase">`

Please note that this code line manages the relative URL, so if you remove it, all your URLs will need to be absolute.
