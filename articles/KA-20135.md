# How to block SQL injection attack


This article describes how to blockÂ SQL injection attack. To do so, use the Apache mod_redirect on the dispatcher at project level.

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

How to block an SQL injection attack?


## Resolution {#resolution}


AEM as a Cloud Service does not offer configurable IP block lists out of the box. Hence use Apache `mod_redirect` or any other approved module on the dispatcher at project level.

SQL injection is prevented by design: The default CQ setup neither includes nor requires a traditional database. All data is stored in a content repository (CRX). All access is limited to authenticated users and can only be performed through the JCR API. SQL is supported for search queries only (`SELECT`).
