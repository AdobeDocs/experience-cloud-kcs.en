# Data is not populating for newly added attribute | AEP


After updating a schema and ingesting data in Adobe Experience Platform, a newly defined attribute does not populate causing production issues. Wait for some time, re-ingest the data, and verify everything is working as expected.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Experience Platform



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

After creating a new schema or updating an existing schema and ingesting data, a newly defined attribute still does not populate - a simple dataset preview on the latest batch validates the issue.


## Resolution {#resolution}


This is most likely a timing issue, please note the schema cache <b>TTL (Time-To-Live)</b> is currently set to 15 minutes. This is the amount of time required for all necessary changes to propagate across the systems.

Wait for about 20 minutes and re-ingest the data to verify everything is working as expected.
