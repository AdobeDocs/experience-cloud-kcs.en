# AEP - Data is not populating in Experience Platform for newly added attribute


After updating a schema and re-ingesting data, a newly defined attribute still does not populate and this is causing production issues.

## Description {#description}

After creating a new schema or updating an existing schema and ingesting data, a newly defined attribute still does not populate - a simple dataset preview on the latest batch validates the issue

## Resolution {#resolution}


This is most likely a timing issue, please note the schema cache TTL (time-To-Live) is currently set to 15 minutes. This is the amount of time required for all necessary changes to propagate across the systems.

Wait for about 20 minutes and re-ingest the data to verify everything is working as expected.
