# missing right to write a nms:webApp

## Description


We have profiles like michael.xxx@mail.com that previously were able to create new webApp.

Now they are unable to create new one and have the messageÂ  QUE-370023 missing right to write a nms:webApp

Can you please have a look we do not understand as nothing has been changed,
if you see the screenshot attached, we can see that webapp has been created by this user previously.

Thank you in advance for your help


## Resolution


I have checked creating a web app from my end and I'm able to do so without any problems. I checked it with Administrator rights.

Also I checked on the operator [!DNL michael].xxx@mail.com and I see that there are no named rights associated with it. Can you please check the same on your end. Here are few documentation links that would help you out:-

1.) https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/getting-started/administration-basics/access-management.html?lang=en#getting-started

2.) https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/getting-started/administration-basics/access-management.html?lang=en#named-rights

3.) https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/getting-started/administration-basics/access-management.html?lang=en#operator-groups



<b>Alternatively, If you want non-admin users to be able to create/edit web application :-</b>

Then issue you are facing is because of the <b>access control</b> setting on the web application templates present under <b>Resources  Templates  Web application templates</b>.

All templates would be set to <b>"Enable access control"</b>.

The setting needs to be changed to <b>Anonymous access</b> as per requirement. If you want non-admin users to be able to create/edit web application, the setting needs to be changed to <b>"Anonymous"</b>
