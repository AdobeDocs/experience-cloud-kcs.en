# Error: Missing right to write a nms:webApp


Set access control to *Anonymous*if you want non-admin users to be able to create new web apps. Admin users should have named rights associated to their profiles to be able to create we apps.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Campaign
- Campaign Classic


### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Profiles that could previously create a new <b>webApp</b>, can no longer do so. They get the following message: *QUE-370023 missing right to write a nms:webApp*




## Resolution {#resolution}


With Administrator rights, we were able to create a web app on our end without any problems.

Check the operator profile to see if there are named rights associated with it. Here are few documentation links that would help you out:

Alternatively, if you want non-admin users to be able to create/edit web application, then:

Issue you are facing is because of the <b>access control</b> setting on the web application templates present under <b>Resources `>`  Templates `>`  Web application templates</b>.

All templates would be set to <b>Enable access control.</b> The setting needs to be changed to <b>Anonymous access</b> as per requirement. If you want non-admin users to be able to create/edit web application, the setting needs to be changed to <b>Anonymous.</b>
