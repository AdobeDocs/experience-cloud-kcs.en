# Message: Missing right to write a nms:webApp

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign
- Campaign Classic

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
We have profiles like michael.xxx@mail.com that previously were able to create new <b>webApp</b>.

Now they are unable to create new one and have the message <b>QUE-370023 missing right to write a nms:webApp</b>

Can you please have a look, we can see that webapp has been created by this user previously.




## Resolution


I have checked creating a web app from my end and I'm able to do so without any problems. I checked it with Administrator rights.

Also, I checked on the operator michael.xxx@mail.com and I see that there are no named rights associated with it. Can you please check the same at your end. Here are few documentation links that would help you out:

- https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/getting-started/administration-basics/access-management.html?lang=en#named-rights
- https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/getting-started/administration-basics/access-management.html?lang=en#operator-groups


Alternatively, if you want non-admin users to be able to create/edit web application, then:

Issue you are facing is because of the <b>access control</b> setting on the web application templates present under <b>Resources  Templates  Web application templates</b>.

All templates would be set to <b>Enable access control.</b>Â The setting needs to be changed to <b>Anonymous access</b> as per requirement. If you want non-admin users to be able to create/edit web application, the setting needs to be changed to <b>Anonymous.</b>
