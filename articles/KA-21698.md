# Project link (URL) generated changes when you share an Adobe Analytics workspace


This article describes the Adobe Analytics issue where a project link changes each time a workspace project link is retrieved in a shared Adobe Analytics workspace. You can use either one of the the newly generated link or the previously generated link for access to the target project.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Analytics

### Issue/Symptoms

When you frequently generate project links while sharing workspaces, you may observe that the URLs change each time they are generated. Additionally, some old links remain accessible.


## Resolution {#resolution}


A new workspace project link (\* *the URL at the end of the link changes*) is generated each time a workspace project link is retrieved. You can access the target workspace project from either the newly generated link or the previously generated link.
