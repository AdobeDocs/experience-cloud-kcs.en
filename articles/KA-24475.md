# Enable Geo-blocking with Dynamic Media CDN


DynamicMedia content is per default available worldwide, with exception of embargoed countries by the US and Russia and China being special areas. Content is only cached within Russia in case the delivery domain's cert is a Standard TLS cert. This is the case for most scene7.com subdomains, but not for vanity (non scene7.com) subdomains. Content is cached within China only when configured to do so, and delivery domain is backed by an ICP license.
 If there is a use-case to have the DM delivery further restricted, this can be configured at CDN level on a per subdomain basis.

## Description {#description}

<b>Description</b> : The customer wants to enable Geo-blocking with the dynamic media CDN, with controlling CDN access based on geographic boundaries. They also want a documentation to implement this.

## Resolution {#resolution}


1) Make sure DM delivery is setup through a dedicated delivery domain, not one of the generic ones other customers make use of such as s7d1.scene7.com, s7g10.scene7.com, s7ap1.scene7.com. This can be setup using a support ticket.
2) Setup the delivery restriction in the CDN config for the delivery domain. This can be setup using a support ticket as well.
