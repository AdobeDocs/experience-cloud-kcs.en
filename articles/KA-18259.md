# Experience Cloud/[!UICONTROL Audience Library]/AAM audiences and segments have no volume or size in Adobe Campaign

## Description

ISSUE/SYMPTOM:
<br>Even though everything seems to be configured correctly, Experience Cloud/[!UICONTROL Audience Library]/AAM audiences and segments have no volume or size in Adobe Campaign
<br> 
<br>ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION:<br>
- Campaign Classic or Campaign Standard
- AAM and/or [!UICONTROL Audience Library]
- Successfully configured [Campaign Standard](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-standard/using/integrating-with-adobe-cloud/working-with-campaign-and-audience-manager-or-people-core-service/provisioning-and-configuring-integration-with-audience-manager-or-people-core-service.html?lang=en) or [Classic](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/integrating-with-adobe-experience-cloud/audience-sharing/configuring-shared-audiences-integration-in-adobe-campaign.html?lang=en) to use Experience Cloud Audiences (People Core service, [!UICONTROL Audience Library], or AAM)
- If Campaign Classic: Users can log into Campaign Classic via Adobe's IMS
- AAM Segment or [!UICONTROL Audience Library] Audience has been configured to send to [!DNL Campaign] using the [!UICONTROL Declared ID] data source within the [!DNL Campaign] UI.



## Resolution


ROOT CAUSES:
Because one of [!DNL Campaign]'s primary purposes is to send messages (email, SMS, etc..) to known individuals, AAM ([!UICONTROL Audience Library]) needs to have the same ID that [!DNL Campaign] uses for customer identification stored in its (AAM's) own [!UICONTROL Declared ID] datasource. For this integration, AAM ([!UICONTROL Audience Library]) is simply sending the list of customer IDs for those customers in the chosen segment/audience to [!DNL Campaign] so that [!DNL Campaign] can identify and build a list of the same people. If AAM doesn't have the IDs to send, no audiences will be sent from AAM ([!UICONTROL Audience Library]) to [!DNL Campaign]. 
 
STEPS TO RESOLVE:
Take the following steps to store the needed customer ID into AAM's [!UICONTROL Declared ID] data source:

1. Ensure that the needed customer ID can be surfaced to the page when the end-user authenticates.
2. When the end-user authenticates, sync the customer identifier with AAM's [!UICONTROL Declared ID] data source via the [setCustomerID function of the Experience Cloud ID service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/id-service/using/id-service-api/methods/setcustomerids.html?lang=en) (or use the Experience Cloud ID Service - Set Customer ID action within [!UICONTROL Data Collection]) using the integration code/alias: `AdobeCampaignID`. For example:

```
Visitor.setCustomerIDs({
     "AdobeCampaignID":{ 
         "id":"YOUR CUSTOMER ID", 
         "authState":Visitor.AuthState.AUTHENTICATED 
     } 
 });
 ```
 
   or in [!UICONTROL Data Collection]:

Where `%custID%` represents a data element where the needed customer ID is stored

3. Validate that the ID is sent to AAM by looking for the d_cid_ic parameter of the demdex.net network call sent when the `setCustomerID` function is called. You should see the `AdobeCampaignID` integration code, the customer ID, and the value of 1 (which means authenticated) separated by a non-printable character.

4. Wait a few days for the customer IDs to be collected in AAM and monitor the audience size in [!DNL Campaign].
