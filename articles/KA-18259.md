# Experience Cloud/Audience Library/AAM audiences and segments have no volume or size in Adobe Campaign


This article addresses the issue where Experience Cloud/Audience Library/AAM audiences and segments have no volume or size in Adobe Campaign, despite being configured correctly. This stems from the fact that AAM (Audience Library) needs to have the same ID that Campaign uses for customer identification stored in its own Declared ID datasource.

## Description {#description}


### Environment









- Adobe Campaign Classic or Standard
- Adobe Audience Manager (AAM) and/or Audience Library
- Successfully configured Campaign [Standard](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-standard/using/integrating-with-adobe-cloud/working-with-campaign-and-audience-manager-or-people-core-service/provisioning-and-configuring-integration-with-audience-manager-or-people-core-service.html?lang=en) or [Classic](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/integrating-with-adobe-experience-cloud/audience-sharing/configuring-shared-audiences-integration-in-adobe-campaign.html?lang=en) to use Experience Cloud Audiences (People Core service, Audience Library, or AAM)
- For Campaign Classic, you can log into Campaign Classic via Adobe's IMS
- AAM Segment or Audience Library Audience has been configured to send to Campaign using the Declared ID data source within the Campaign UI


### Issue/Symptoms 

Even though everything seems to be configured correctly, Experience Cloud/Audience Library/AAM audiences and segments have no volume or size in Adobe Campaign.


## Resolution {#resolution}


### Cause

Because one of Campaign's primary purposes is to send messages (email, SMS, etc..) to known individuals, AAM (Audience Library) needs to have the same ID that Campaign uses for user identification stored in its (AAM's) own Declared ID datasource. For this integration, AAM (Audience Library) is simply sending the list of user IDs to Campaign for those that are in the chosen segment/audience,  so that Campaign can identify and build a list of the same people. If AAM doesn't have the IDs to send, no audiences will be sent from AAM (Audience Library) to Campaign.

### Steps to resolve

Take the following steps to store the needed user ID into AAM's Declared ID data source:

1. Ensure that the needed user ID can be surfaced to the page when the end-user authenticates.
2. When the end-user authenticates, sync the user identifier with AAM's Declared ID data source via the [setuserID function of the Experience Cloud ID service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/id-service/using/id-service-api/methods/setcustomerids.html?lang=en) (or use the Experience Cloud ID Service - set user ID action within Data Collection) using the integration code/alias: `AdobeCampaignID`. For example:    


    ```
    Visitor.setuserIDs({
             "AdobeCampaignID":{ 
                 "id":"YOUR user ID", 
                 "authState":Visitor.AuthState.AUTHENTICATED 
            } 
     });
    ```

    
    or in Data Collection:

    Where `%custID%` represents a data element where the needed user ID is stored.
3. Validate that the ID is sent to AAM by looking for the `d_cid_ic` parameter of the `demdex.net` network call sent when the `setuserID` function is called. You should see the `AdobeCampaignID` integration code, the user ID, and the value of 1 (which means authenticated) separated by a non-printable character.    ![](assets/4f9305cf-76a5-ec11-983f-0022480b028f.png)
4. Wait a few days for the user IDs to be collected in AAM and monitor the audience size in Campaign.
