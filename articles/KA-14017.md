# How are the criteria for the last purchased/viewed item determined on Recommendations

## Description




- How is the last purchased/viewed item determined?
- Do they work on the entire traffic of a specific site?
- Are they influenced by site owners' navigation





## Resolution


- The Criteria for the <b>last purchased/viewed item </b>are based on your behavior.
- Last purchased would be your last product ID seen in the order confirmation mbox.
- The Last Viewed would be your last product ID to increment a product viewÂ which typically means the PDP.
