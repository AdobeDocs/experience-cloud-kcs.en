# How are the criteria "last purchased/viewed item" determined on Recommendations

## Description


About "last purchased/viewed item", Give me a bit more detail on how these are determined? Do they work on the entire traffic of a specific site? Are they influenced by our own (your cookie) navigation?




## Resolution


The Criteria "last purchased/viewed item" are based on your behavior.

Last purchased would be your last product ID seen in the orderConfirmation mbox,

The Last Viewed would be your last product ID to increment a product view which typically means the PDP.
