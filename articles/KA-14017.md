# How criteria for last purchased/viewed item determined on [!UICONTROL Recommendations]

## Description


<b>Environment</b>

Target



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

- How is the last purchased/viewed item determined?
- Do they work on the entire traffic of a specific site?
- Are they influenced by site owners' navigation?





## Resolution


- The criteria for the <b>last purchased/viewed item </b>are based on your behavior.
- The last purchased would be your last product ID seen in the order confirmation mbox.
- The last viewed would be your last product ID to increment a product viewÂ which typically means the PDP.
