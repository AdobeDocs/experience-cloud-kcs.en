# Adobe Experience Manager: How to download assets with cURL

## Description {#description}


By using cURL, you can download multiple assets with a command at once. This way is useful for the following use cases:

- Download assets automatically
- Download assets in several folders
- Download particular assets in a folder


<b>Environments</b>

AEM 6.5


## Resolution {#resolution}


Specify the asset or folder path to be downloaded in a cURL command.

<u>Download a single asset</u>


```
$ curl -u user:password -o output file name http://localhost:4502/asset path.assetdownload.zip
```


Example:


```
$ curl -u user:password -o download_asset.zip http://localhost:4502/content/dam/we-retail/en/features/tracking.png.assetdownload.zip
```


<u>Download all assets in a single folder</u>


```
$ curl -u user:password -o output file name http://localhost:4502/asset path.assetdownload.zip
```


Example:


```
$ curl -u user:password -o download_asset.zip http://localhost:4502/content/dam/we-retail/en/people.assetdownload.zip
```


<u>Download multiple folders and assets at once</u>


```
$ curl -u user:password -o output file name -F "path=path A" -F "path=path B" -F ... http://localhost:4502/path A.assetdownload.zip
```


Example:


```
$ curl -u admin:admin -o download_asset.zip -F "path=/content/dam/we-retail/en/people" -F "path=/content/dam/we-retail/en/experiences" -F "path=/content/dam/we-retail/en/features/tracking.png" http://localhost:4502/content/dam/we-retail/en/people.assetdownload.zip
```


Specify path A.assetdownload.zip for the path part of the URL.

Downloading a large number of assets at once may cause performance problems. Adjust the number of assets monitoring the server load.
