# Changing a folder title in properties doesn't change the folder name but ads a property called title.

## Description


Changing a folder title in properties doesn't change the folder name but ads a property called title.


## Resolution


Yes, this is expected. In AEM, when we open folder properties, we can only change the Folder Title and NOT the folder name.

However, we can still change the folder name but for that, we need to use the "Move" option with which the folder name can be changed.
