# Changing a folder title in properties doesn't change the folder name

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
Experience Manager as a Cloud Service


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
Changing a folder title in properties doesn't change the folder name but adds a property called <b>Title</b>


## Resolution {#resolution}

Yes, this is expected. In AEM, when we open folder properties, we can only change the Folder Title and not the folder name.<br>
However, we can still change the folder name, but for that, we need to use the "<b>Move</b>" option with which the folder name can be changed.
