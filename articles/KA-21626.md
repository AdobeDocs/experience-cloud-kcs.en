# Target destination stuck in 'delete-failed' status

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- Adobe Target
- Adobe Experience Platform (AEP)



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
You have an AEP Target connection. After attempting to delete a segment from the AEP user interface (UI) that was sent to Target, you see the destination status as <b>Error.</b>


## Resolution {#resolution}


Un-map the segments in AEP. The segments are then removed automatically from Target.

To un-map segments in AEP:

1. Go to the <b>Destinations</b> tab in AEP UI.
2. Click on the desired destination from the list. It will display a list of segments that are activated to the destination.
3. Select the segment you would like to un-map, and click on <b>Remove Segment</b>.

<b>Cause</b>
The DELETE destination failed because some of the mapped segments were already removed from Target, since then the destination was in a DELETE-Stuck state.
