# Share link expiry date is different in email

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Platform

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

For the share link functionality in Brand Portal (BP), the selected expiration date does not match the date in email notification.


## Resolution {#resolution}


This is as designed. The date/time displayed in email is server time, while the time shown in browser (while performing link share) is the local time (i.e. the time of system on which link share is being done).

For example, if server time is UTC and link share is being done on a system which has IST time zone, then time in email will be 07/08/2022 3:02 PM and the corresponding date/time browser will be 2022-08-07 20:32.

Both these correspond to the same time but the difference is that the time shown in email is in UTC while that shown in browser is in local time IST.
