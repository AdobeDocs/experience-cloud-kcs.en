## Resolution {#resolution}

<b>Follow the steps given below:</b>
1. Locate in the root of the Git Repo, the file `pom.xml,` and find the node version, for e.g., `nodeVersionv10.13.0/nodeVersion`


2. Locate `ui.frontend/package.json,` and add in the already present `devDependencies` object:
    for e.g.,"devDependencies":

    ![](assets/007186ff-51eb-ed11-a7c6-6045bd006e5a.png)



<br>Note:<br>


1. The v from nodeVersion<b>v10.13.0</b> must not be copied.


2. The node version might be different in your case. For e.g.: <b>12.22.7</b>
