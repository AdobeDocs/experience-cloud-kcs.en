# Pipeline deployment is failing during the build step

## Description {#description}


<b>Description</b> : The pipeline execution is failing during the build step due to errors in the ui.frontend code

You observe ERROR messages like the below in the build.log file:


```
12:52:44,558 Exec Stream Pumper INFO ERROR in /build_root/build/program/ui.frontend/node_modules/@types/node/ts4.8/util.d.ts12:52:44,559 Exec Stream Pumper INFO tsl ERROR in /build_root/build/program/ui.frontend/node_modules/@types/node/ts4.8/util.d.ts(1485,42)12:52:44,561 Exec Stream Pumper INFO TS1005: ',' expected.12:52:44,561 Exec Stream Pumper INFO12:52:44,561 Exec Stream Pumper INFO ERROR in /build_root/build/program/ui.frontend/node_modules/@types/node/ts4.8/util.d.ts12:52:44,562 Exec Stream Pumper INFO tsl ERROR in /build_root/build/program/ui.frontend/node_modules/@types/node/ts4.8/util.d.ts(1485,44)12:52:44,563 Exec Stream Pumper INFO TS1068: Unexpected token.

```



## Resolution {#resolution}


- locate in the root of the git repo the file pom.xml and find the node version
 e.g.: nodeVersionv10.13.0/nodeVersion

 - locate ui.frontend/package.json and add in already present devDependencies object:
 e.g.:
 "devDependencies": {
 "@types/node": "10.13.0",
 ...

 Note:
 1. the v from nodeVersionv10.13.0 must not be copied.
 2. the node version might be different in your case. e.g.: 12.22.7
