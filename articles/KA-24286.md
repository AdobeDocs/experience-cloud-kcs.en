# Adobe Campaign Standard: Users not removed from Adobe Campaign Security Groups

## Description {#description}


It has been reported that issues where past Adobe Campaign Standard (ACS) users have been removed from the Adobe Console as a user. However, if these users still exist within ACS as workflow supervisors, users will continue to receive alerts/notifications for any workflows that they are associated with. The cause of this issue is syncing logic, which requires users to log into the console for updates to occur. Since the users no longer have access to the console, they cannot log in, which prevents a sync from taking place and removes users from associated products, such as ACS.


## Resolution {#resolution}


To address this issue in the interim, please engage Campaign Support, who can work with the internal Ops team to run the following SQL statements to remove disabled users from the workflow supervisors groups.

Select \*
From xtkgroupuserrel
Where iuserid in (select iuserid from xtkuser where idisabled=1);

Delete
From xtkgroupuserrel
Where iuserid in (select iuserid from xtkuser where idisabled=1);

This issue has also been reported to Adobe R&D via CAMP-56128 to be addressed permanently in a future release.
