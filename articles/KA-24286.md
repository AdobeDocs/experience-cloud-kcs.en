# Adobe Campaign Standard: Users not removed from Adobe Campaign Security Groups


Learn howÂ to remove disabled users from the workflow supervisors groups.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

- Adobe Campaign
- Adobe Campaign Standard


### Issue/Symptoms

An issue has been reported where past Adobe Campaign Standard (ACS) users are removed from the Adobe Console. However, if you still exist within ACS as a workflow supervisor, you will continue to receive alerts/notifications for any workflows that you are associated with. The cause of this issue is syncing logic, which requires you to log into the console for updates to occur. Since you no longer have access to the console, you cannot log in, which prevents a sync from taking place and removes you from associated products, such as ACS.


## Resolution {#resolution}


To address this issue in the interim, please engage Campaign Support, who can work with the internal Ops team to run the following SQL statements to remove disabled users from the workflow supervisors groups.

Select \*
From xtkgroupuserrel
Where iuserid in (select iuserid from xtkuser where idisabled=1);

Delete
From xtkgroupuserrel
Where iuserid in (select iuserid from xtkuser where idisabled=1);

This issue has also been reported to Adobe R&D via CAMP-56128 to be addressed permanently in a future release.
