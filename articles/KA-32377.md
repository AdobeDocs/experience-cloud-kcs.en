## Description

Artificial Intelligence is becoming commonplace across major industries and retail is no exception.The retail industry is looking for ways to keep up with the times and many companies have started implementing AI technology across the entire product and service cycle<u> – from assembly to post-sale customer service interactions.Major retailers such as Walmart, Sephora, Walgreens, North Face, Uniqlo, West Elm, and Macy’</u>s are using AI to enhance customers’ experiences at their stores while also improving security. AI Applications in Retail While hardware giant Lowe’s uses small robots to give directions and help customers navigate a large hardware store, Walgreens is using technology to track the spread of flu, based on the locations of custome*rs picking up prescriptions so they can alert customers to the flu activity in their area and stock more flu-related products.Another example is makeup company Sephora, which now uses AI technology in many of its stores to scan customers’ faces and help them choose the perfect shade of blush, lipstick, or eyeliner without having to test multiple products.*

Meanwhile, a Walmart store in New York is becoming the "store of the future" by incorporating the latest AI technology. The store’s smart cameras will have the capability to alert workers when items are out of stock and even let them know when a bunch of bananas has gone bad. Providing a Customizable Retail Experience Artificial intelligence is being used for everything from preparing packages in warehouses to enhancing security to creating a customized experience for consumers.One company that is delivering solutions to retail and security is [VSBLTY Groupe Technologies Corp.](https://vsblty.net/) [(CSE:VSBY)](https://microsmallcap.com/stock-quote/VSBY:CNX/) [(OTC:VSBGF)](https://microsmallcap.com/stock-quote/VSBGF/).
