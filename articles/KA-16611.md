How to confirm if an MVPD is enabled for [!DNL Apple] SSO


## Resolution

<b>Steps:</b>
1. Navigate to this URL (for Production) - [sp.auth.adobe.com/api/v1/config/requester-ID?deviceType=iOS](http://sp.auth.adobe.com/api/v1/config/ABC?deviceType=iOS)
2. Replace requester-ID with the Channel\ Programmer's requester ID
3. To check for different Programmers, simply change the requester ID with next one
4. Check for the tag <b>boardingStatus </b>of<b> </b>the MVPD . If you see it as <b>SUPPORTED</b> i.e. *boardingStatusSUPPORTED/boardingStatus* for listed MVPDs - these are the ones supporting AppleSSO completely.
5. If you status as '<b>PICKER</b>' it means it's just going to be displayed in the [!DNL Apple] Picker but actually will go through Adobe.


*Note:*[sp.auth.adobe.com/api/v1/config/requester-ID](http://sp.auth.adobe.com/api/v1/config/ABC?deviceType=iOS) can be used to locate the MVPDs integrated with a Channel/Programmer.  <b>Additional information on [!DNL Apple] SSO enabled MVPDs:</b>

When configuration is retrieved from Adobe endpoint, the following additional fields can be seen present for those MVPDs which are part of the [!DNL Apple] SSO:


> *enablePlatformServicestrue/enablePlatformServices<br>displayInPlatformPickertrue/displayInPlatformPicker<br>boardingStatus<b>SUPPORTED</b>/boardingStatus<br>enforcePlatformPermissionstrue/enforcePlatformPermissions<br>platformMappingId visible="true".../platformMappingId<br>requiredMetadataFields<br>attributeuid/attribute<br>attributeuniqueId/attribute<br>/requiredMetadataFields*


From these parameters, the boardingStatus informs the user about the [!DNL Apple] SSO status for a Programmer:

- <b>SUPPORTED</b> means that you can actually login in device TV Provider settings window hence these are completely supported by [!DNL Apple] and will use [!DNL Apple]'s SSO token.
- <b>PICKER</b> means the MVPD can appear in picker window, but the actual authentication needs to be done through normal flows (in browser or 2nd screen device) i.e. authentication flow is done via Adobe.
- <b>UNSUPPORTED</b> means the MVPD is not part of the [!DNL Apple] SSO system and also will not appear in system settings.
