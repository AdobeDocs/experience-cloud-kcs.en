# Upload file to Azure blob storage - CRL-290029 Forbidden


This article addresses the Campaign Classic issue where you can only read files but cannot write files in the blob storage. To resolve this, contact Azure to whitelist IP.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Classic v7

### Issue/Symptoms

1. You are integrating Adobe Campaign Classic v7 with Adobe Experience Platform, and you have created a workflow as described in [Create an export workflow in Campaign Classic](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/integrating-with-adobe-experience-cloud/aep-sources-destinations/export-campaign-data.html?lang=en#create-an-export-workflow-in-campaign-classic) in Campaign Classic v7 Documentation. This is in order to export data from ACC to the Azure blob storage location.
2. You try to add a File transfer activity (Action-File upload) to Azure Blob. In the [Audit Trail](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic-learn/tutorials/monitoring/audit-trail.html?lang=en) logs, you see the following error:


*CRL-290182 Error occurred while uploading 'https://ocuazfcucsa002.blob.core.windows.net/campaign/IngestaAEP/Feedback/envioCDP.csv' to Azure Blob Storage (code CRL-290029 Forbidden - The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it)*

The result is that you can read files from the blob storage (download), but you cannot write files there (upload).


## Resolution {#resolution}


IP needs to be whitelisted on the Azure side. Contact Azure support for this request.
