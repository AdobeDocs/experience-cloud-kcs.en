# Upload file to Azure blob storage - CRL-290029 Forbidden

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Classic v7

### Issue/Symptoms

1. You are integrating Adobe Campaign Classic v7 with Adobe Experience Platform, and you have created a workflow as described in [Create an export workflow in Campaign Classic](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/integrating-with-adobe-experience-cloud/aep-sources-destinations/export-campaign-data.html?lang=en#create-an-export-workflow-in-campaign-classic) in Campaign Classic v7 Documentation. This is in order to export data from ACC to the Azure blob storage location.
2. You try to add a File transfer activity (Action-File upload) to Azure Blob. In the [Audit Trail](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic-learn/tutorials/monitoring/audit-trail.html?lang=en) logs, you see the following error:


*CRL-290182 Error occurred while uploading 'https://ocuazfcucsa002.blob.core.windows.net/campaign/IngestaAEP/Feedback/envioCDP.csv' to Azure Blob Storage (code CRL-290029 Forbidden - The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it)*

The result is that you can read files from the blob storage (download), but you cannot write files there (upload).


## Resolution {#resolution}


IP needs to be whitelisted on the Azure side. Contact Azure support for this request.
