# The date period in the Server call usage UI and the contract are mismatched for the Adobe Analytics

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Analytics


### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
<br><br>Why are the date period in the Server Call Usage UI and the date in the contract are mismatched. <br><br>
<br>For example, in the Adobe Analytics contract the date period is 20/10/2021   19/01/2023.<br><br>
<br>However, in the Server Call Usage UI the date period is 20/10/2021   19/10/2022.<br><br> <br><br>![](assets/___728f0faa-ef05-ee11-8f6e-6045bd006b3d___.png)<br>

## Resolution {#resolution}


It is working as designed. The date period in the server call usage UI depends on the commit cycle months, not on the contract's service start/end dates.

The commit cycle months for the above customer is by billing for 12 months increments. When this commit cycle ends on 19/10/2022, their next commit cycle will be three months and end on 19/01/2023.
