Learn how to fix the mismatched date period in the Server call usage UI and the contract.

For example, in the Adobe Analytics contract the date period is 20/10/2021 ~ 19/01/2023.

However, in the Server Call Usage UI the date period is 20/10/2021 ~ 19/10/2022.

## Resolution {#resolution}


It is working as designed. The date period in the server call usage UI depends on the commit cycle months, not on the contract's service start/end dates.

The commit cycle months for the above user is by billing for 12 months increments. When this commit cycle ends on 19/10/2022, their next commit cycle will be three months and the end date being 19/01/2023.
