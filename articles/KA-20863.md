# The date period in the Server call usage UI and the contract are mismatched for the Adobe Analytics

## Description {#description}

<br>The date period in the Server Call Usage UI and the date in the contract are mismatched. Why?<br><br>
<br>For example, in the Adobe Analytics contract the date period is  20/Oct/2021 ~ 19/Jan/2023.<br><br>
<br>However, in the Server Call Usage UI the date period is 20/Oct/2021 ~ 19/Oct/2022.<br><br> <br><br> <br><br>![](assets/___1c772bee-2e54-ed11-bba2-6045bd006b4b___.png)<br>

## Resolution {#resolution}


It is working as designed.
The date period in the server call usage UI depends on the commit cycle months, not on the contract's service start/end dates.
The commit cycle months for the above customer is by billing for 12 months increments.
When this commit cycle ends on 10/19/2022, their next commit cycle will be 3 months and end on 19/Jan/2023.
