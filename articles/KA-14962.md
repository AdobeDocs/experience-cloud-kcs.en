# INT-150012 The HTTP query returned a 'Request Entity Too Large' type error (413)

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
Campaign Classic
<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
WhenÂ trying to upload data files greater than 50 MB in ACC via workflows, following error occurs:



Error message:

INT-150012 The HTTP query returned a 'Request Entity Too Large' type error (413)


## Resolution


The reason for this is that in ACC 17.4.1 build 8797, a content length limit was introduced for Apache and Internet Information Services (IIS). This limit is set to 50MB by default and can be modified from the initial value of 52428800. The configuration file containing this value is the `httpd.conf`

Example within Apache:


```
httpd.conf
...
  CampaignLimitRequest "52428800"
...
```
