# Request Entity Too Large error when uploading a file larger than 50MB in Adobe Campaign


Modify the content limit in the Apache `httpd.conf` file to solve the *Request Entity Too Large* type error.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Campaign Classic

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

When trying to upload data files larger than 50 MB in ACC via workflows, you get the following error message: *INT-150012 The HTTP query returned a 'Request Entity Too Large' type error (413)*.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The reason for this is that in ACC 17.4.1 build 8797 a content length limit was introduced for Apache and Internet Information Services (IIS). This limit is set to 50MB by default. You can modify the limit by changing the `CampaignLimitRequest` value in the `httpd.conf` Apache config file.

Example within Apache:


```
httpd.conf
...
  CampaignLimitRequest "52428800"
...
```
