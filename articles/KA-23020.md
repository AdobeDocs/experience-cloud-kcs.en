# Adobe Experience Manager: Language copy does not adjust links inside the page


In AEM 6.5.16, links inside the pages of a language copy do not adjust to the local language path. This issue should be resolved in AEM 6.5.19.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environments</b>

AEM 6.5.16 - 6.5.18

### Issue/Symptoms

After installing AEM 6.5.16, the links inside the pages of a language copy no longer get adjusted to the local language path.

#### Steps to reproduce

Step 1. Open `/wknd/language-masters/en/about-us` with the page editor.

Step 2. Add a <b>Button</b> component to the page.

Step 3. Configure the <b>Button</b> and set `/content/wknd/language-masters/en/faqs` as the <b>Link</b>.

Step 4. Create a language copy of the `/wknd/language-masters/en/about-us`.

Step 5. Choose a <b>Target Language</b>, for example, Japanese.

Step 6. Open the language copy `/wknd/language-masters/ja/about-us`.

The link of the button should be adjusted to `/content/wknd/language-masters/ja/faqs`. However, the actual path is still `/content/wknd/language-masters/en/faqs` in AEM 6.5.16.


## Resolution {#resolution}


AEM 6.5.19 will contain the fix for this issue (NPR-41364).
