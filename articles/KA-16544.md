# Change the minification engine for client libraries in AEM


This article addresses the Adobe Experience Manager issue where you want use a different minification library for AEM client libraries other than the default YUI Compressor library. You may use the Google Closure Compiler (GCC); see through the client library nodes that use GCC for JS below.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager 6.4, 6.5

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

How to use a different minification library for AEM client libraries than the default YUI Compressor library?


## Resolution {#resolution}


In AEM, you can swap out the YUI engine with GCC (Google Closure Compiler https://github.com/google/closure-compiler-js).

For example, see these client library nodes that use GCC for JS:


```
/libs/granite/contexthub/dependencies/coralui
/etc/clientlibs/granite/coralui3
/etc/clientlibs/granite/coralui2
/libs/dam/gui/coral/components/admin/adhocassetshare/clientlibs/adhocassetshare
/libs/dam/gui/components/admin/adhocassetshare/clientlibs/shareembedded
/etc/clientlibs/screens/player/shared
/etc/clientlibs/screens/player/firmware
/libs/dam/gui/components/admin/adhocassetshare/clientlibs/shareembeddedpreview
/apps/geometrixx-instore/clientlibs
```


*Note:* If you want to implement your own custom script processor, then you would implement this Java interface:
`com.adobe.granite.ui.clientlibs.script.ScriptProcessor`

RELATED JAVADOC:

[Interface ScriptProcessor](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/sites/developing/using/reference-materials/javadoc/com/adobe/granite/ui/clientlibs/script/ScriptProcessor.html)

This allows you to define` ScriptProcessors `that can modify script sources:

- the processors are configurable with options
- the processor can be used for minification but also for non-minified cases


CONFIGURATION:

- The default `ScriptProcessors `options can be set via the *HTML Library Manager OSGi*configuration (in the `/system/console/configMgr` UI).


OPTIONS FOR GCC ARE:

- `failOnWarning` (defaults to *false*)
- `languageIn` (defaults to *ECMASCRIPT5*)
- `languageOut` (defaults to *ECMASCRIPT5*)
- `compilationLevel` (defaults to *simple*) (can be *whitespace*, *simple*, *advanced*)
