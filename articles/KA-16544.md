# Change the minification engine for client libraries in AEM

## Description

How to use a different minification library for AEM client libraries than the default YUI Compressor library?


Environment



AEM 6.4,6.5

## Resolution

In AEM, you can swap out yui engine with GCC (Google Closure Compiler https://github.com/google/closure-compiler-js). 

For example, see these client library nodes that use GCC for js:

/libs/granite/contexthub/dependencies/coralui /etc/clientlibs/granite/coralui3 /etc/clientlibs/granite/coralui2 /libs/dam/gui/coral/components/admin/adhocassetshare/clientlibs/adhocassetshare /libs/dam/gui/components/admin/adhocassetshare/clientlibs/shareembedded /etc/clientlibs/screens/player/shared /etc/clientlibs/screens/player/firmware /libs/dam/gui/components/admin/adhocassetshare/clientlibs/shareembeddedpreview /apps/geometrixx-instore/clientlibs


Note: If you want to implement your own custom script processor, then you would implement this java interface:
com.adobe.granite.ui.clientlibs.script.ScriptProcessor

RELATED JAVADOC:



[https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/sites/developing/using/reference-materials/javadoc/com/adobe/granite/ui/clientlibs/script/ScriptProcessor.html](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/sites/developing/using/reference-materials/javadoc/com/adobe/granite/ui/clientlibs/script/ScriptProcessor.html) 

This allows you to define ScriptProcessors that can modify script sources:

*   the processors are configurable with options
 
*   the processor can be used for minification, but also for non-minified cases


CONFIGURATION:



*   The default ScriptProcessors options can be set via the HTML Library Manager OSGi configuration (in the /system/console/configMgr UI).


OPTIONS FOR GCC ARE:



*   failOnWarning (defaults to "false")
 
*   languageIn (defaults to "ECMASCRIPT5")
 
*   languageOut (defaults to "ECMASCRIPT5")
 
*   compilationLevel (defaults to "simple") (can be "whitespace", "simple", "advanced")
