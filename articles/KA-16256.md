## Resolution


<b>What happens when a user clicks on unsubscribe in an email?</b>

There are two ways a user can unsubscribe from emails. Let’s understand the two kinds of <b>Unsubscribe</b>:

1. <b>When the user clicks on the client's Unsubscribe link in the body of the email</b>
    When a user clicks on the U<b>nsubscribe link</b> in the body of an email (click here), the *Subscriptions* table is updated for that recipient, and they will be unsubscribed in that table from that specific email type/brand/domain. In this case, the recipient will be available for all the future deliveries from the instance other than the *type/brand/domain* they unsubscribed from. Please note this situation is <b>not</b> a *bounce*, it is a true <b>Unsubscribe</b>.
2. <b>The user clicks on the Unsubscribe link in the email client itself</b>
    A click on the <b>Unsubscribe link</b> in the email client itself (Gmail, Yahoo), will cause Unsubscribe email to be sent back to the client's instance (Campaign), and that email will be processed by <b>InMail</b>, and should match the `Email_client_unsubscribe` Inbound email rule. If it does, then that recipient will be shown as *Quarantined* in the <b>Quarantine</b> list, and will no longer be sent any emails, for any brand, from that instance. The <b>Quarantine</b> table will be then updated, and for that reason, in Campaign, this situation is considered as a *Hard bounce*. Though, this situation is not a *bounc*e, technically. It is considered as such, since the <b>Subscription</b> table cannot be accessed in such situation, so Campaign cannot unsubscribe the recipient as requested. All <b>InMail</b> process can do is to update the <b>Quarantine</b> table.
