# No Error or Warning message when moving page to not allowed destination

## Description

When we tried to move pages to a new destination, they did not move.<br>They stayed in the old destination and had only a confusing note „Completed asyncPageMove” (see move-pages.png). And in the list of jobs, these actions are set to "Job successfully completed", but the pages did not move (see list-jobs.png).<br><br>After we checked the allowed template in the new destination, we noticed that the template of the moved pages where not allowed there. After allowing them, we could move them to the new destination.<br><br>Please check our case an improve the moving process by checking if a page is allowed in the destination and display a message if the move action cannot be performed.
