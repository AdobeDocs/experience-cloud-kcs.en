# Image sizes reduced served by [!DNL Target] activity using [!DNL Scene7]

## Description

<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Target

<b>Issue</b>

When you use the [!UICONTROL Swap Image] functionality in [!DNL Target VEC], while creating an activity experience, the size of the image (used to swap the image) is reduced when the activity is delivered.

<b>Cause</b>

At the time of swap image, the height and width are calculated from the `computedStyle` of the website (style in displaying the element, after stylings from multiple sources have been applied).

There is no inbuilt product capability to remove those parameters.

## Resolution

<b>Workarounds</b>

1. Instead of swapping the image, you can edit the source of the image, and place the [!DNL Scene7] URL by removing/updating these parameters.

   OR

1. Another way to remove height and width is by editing the html on the parent of the swapped image.

<b>Additional Question</b>

<b>Question:</b> How do you fetch the [!DNL Scene7] URL for each image? 

<b>Answer: </b>You will get the [!DNL Scene7] URL at the time of offer delivery, or you can fetch the activity definition from TNT ([!DNL Target] Classic). There is no upfront way to get the [!DNL Scene7] URL prior to activity save.
