# Image sizes reduced served by Target activity using Scene7

## Description


<b>Issue</b>

When you use the swap image functionality in Target VEC, while creating an activity experience, the size of the image (used to swap the image) is reduced when the activity is delivered.



<b>Cause</b>

At the time of swap image, the height and width are calculated from the computedStyle of the website (style in displaying the element, after stylings from multiple sources have been applied).

There is no inbuilt product capability to remove those parameters.








## Resolution


<b>Workarounds</b>

1. Instead of swapping the image, you can edit the source of the image, and place the scene7 URL by removing/updating these parameters.

OR

2. Another way to remove height and width is by editing the html on the parent of the swapped image.



<b>Additional Question</b>

<b>Question:</b> How do you fetch the Scene7 URL for each image? 

<b>Answer: </b>You will get the Scene7 URL at the time of offer delivery, or you can fetch the activity definition from TNT (Target Classic).
There is no upfront way to get the Scene7 URL prior to activity save.
