# Analyzing the request.log file for traffic patterns


The following steps show how to analyze `request.log` by generating a traffic graph and then generating cross-references to the output of the `request.log` and `rlog.jar` tools.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

How to analyze the `request.log` file for traffic patterns?


## Resolution {#resolution}


1. Install <b>Perl </b>(Programming language developed for text manipulation) and <b>Gnuplot </b>(portable command-line) on your desktop and for Windows OS, install <b>Cygwin </b>(Unix-like environment and command-line interface). 

    When installing <b>Cygwin</b>, be sure to include <b>Perl </b>and<b> Gnuplot</b> during the installation in the <b>Select Packages </b>step. On Mac OS(X), install <b>Brew </b>(free and open-source software package management system).


    After installing <b>Brew</b>, open the Mac Terminal application and run <b>Brew </b>to install <b>Gnuplot</b>.
2. Download the two following files to a new folder on the computer.

    [graph-request-log.pl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joerghoh/cq5-utils/master/scripts/request.log/graph-request-log.pl)

    [requestlog.pm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joerghoh/cq5-utils/master/scripts/request.log/requestlog.pm)
3. Run the command for the path of `request.log`: <b> </b>


    `Perl and graph-request-log.pl --title Request Log Graph --output output.png request.log | Gnuplot`.


    The command produces a file named `output.png` similar to the following:

To understand the graph above, one must understand what [median](https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/median.html) and [percentile](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/percentiles.html) mean. As shown in the graph users don't use the system until around 7 am. The traffic picks up around 9 am. The traffic then increases further at 11:30 AM, and a spike in the number of requests and slower response times (visible by the median response time and 98th percentile markings). View the [Readme file](https://github.com/joerghoh/cq5-utils/tree/master/scripts/request.log) for more information about this graphing tool's documentation.

1. Now that the graph has been used to find important time periods, cross-reference the selected times in the log files (such as request.log and error.log). One easy way to view large files is to use the <b>[less](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less_%28Unix%29)</b>command on the shell (Cygwin on Windows or Terminal on Mac). For example, run this command <b>less request.log</b> and search for <b>/2016 11:3`[` 0-9`]` :</b>, and press <b>Enter</b> to select the timeframe to 11:30 AM in the file and then click on Search.<br>
2. A cross-reference on the graphs against the output of the `rlog.jar` application shipped with AEM under opt/helpers can also be done. Instructions can be found in [AEM docs.](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-release-information/aem-release-updates/previous-updates/aem-previous-versions)
