## Resolution {#resolution}


If there is a key stored on your computer, manually remove the license key entries in your computer's registry to get the new key to work.

<b>Note: </b>This process requires Administrator rights. It also requires the adjustment of the Windows Registry.

1. Choose <b>Start </b>and then go to <b>Run</b>
2. Type *regedit* and click <b>OK</b>
3. Navigate to: <b>/HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/CLSID</b>
4. Look for and delete {F18C1202-9D2E-4BE4-AB18-99C7E870D28A}
5. For newer style keys (64-bit windows), there is a second location as well:
    1. Navigate to \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Classes\CLSID\
    2. Look for and delete {F18C1202-9D2E-4BE4-AB18-99C7E870D28A}\Licenses
6. Close <b>regedit</b>
7. Rerun the new .reg file once more if trying to resolve a new license key issue
