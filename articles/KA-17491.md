How to remove a Windows Scene7 license key?


## Resolution {#resolution}


If there is a key stored on your computer, manually remove the license key entries in your computer's registry to get the new key to work.

<b>Note:Â </b>This process requires Administrator rights. It also requires the adjustment of the Windows Registry.

1. Choose Start  Run.
2. Type "regedit" and click OK.
3. Navigate to: /HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/CLSID
4. Look for and delete {F18C1202-9D2E-4BE4-AB18-99C7E870D28A}
5. For newer style keys (64-bit windows), there is a second location as well:
    1. Navigate to \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Classes\CLSID\
    2. Look for and delete {F18C1202-9D2E-4BE4-AB18-99C7E870D28A}\Licenses
6. Close regedit.
7. Rerun the new .reg file once more if trying to resolve a new license key issue.
