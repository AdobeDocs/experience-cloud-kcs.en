# Campaign Classic V7: How to install Campaign Optimization package?

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Campaign Classic
- Campaign
- Campaign Classic v7


<b>Issue/symptoms</b>
 The Typology Pressure and Capacity rules are added as part of an independent package installation, i.e., Campaign Optimization. If they are missing, it is because the module Campaign Optimization is not installed.
 This module is needed to enable pressure rules application on deliveries.




## Resolution {#resolution}


If your instance is hosted by Adobe, you should contact Support to have the package installed if eligible for *Campaign Optimization* module.

If the your pack is not eligible, then you need to contact your Adobe Account TeamÂ or Adobe Account Executive to purchase the required license(s).

The module would then be added.
