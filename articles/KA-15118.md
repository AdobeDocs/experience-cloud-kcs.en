# Campaign Standard - Where can client check location of logs coming from SMS provider in ACS UI ?

## Description


Where can clients check the logs coming from an SMS provider in ACS UI?


## Resolution


In Campaign Classic it can be via Monitoring SMS logs but in Campaign Standard, there is no SMS process.

MTA handles both sending and receiving SR+MO.

These logs are not available in the UI and the only way is to raise a ticket [!DNL Adobe] Support which can get the logs for the client.
