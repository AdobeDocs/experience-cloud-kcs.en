# Where can client check location of logs coming from SMS provider in ACS UI ?

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign Standard



<b>Issues/Symptoms</b>
Where can clients check the logs coming from an SMS provider in ACS UI?


## Resolution {#resolution}


In Campaign Classic it can be via Monitoring SMS logs but in Campaign Standard, there is no SMS process.

MTA handles both sending and receiving SR+MO.

These logs are not available in the UI and the only way is to raise a ticket Adobe Support which can get the logs for the client.
