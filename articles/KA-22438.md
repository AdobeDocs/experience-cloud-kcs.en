# Test_Special Char

## Description {#description}


<b>Example 1 - Force SSL</b>

The variables shown above `AUTHOR_FORCE_SSL`, or `PUBLISH_FORCE_SSL` can be set to 1 to engage rewrite rules that force end users when coming in on http request to be redirected to https.

Here is the configuration file syntax that allows this toggle to work:


```
<VirtualHost *:80>

  <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>

    ReWriteEngine    on

    <If "${PUBLISH_FORCE_SSL} == 1">

      Include /etc/httpd/conf.d/rewrites/forcessl_rewrite.rules

    </If>

  </IfModule>

</VirtualHost>
```


As you can see the rewrite rules include is what has the code to redirect the end users browser, but the variable being set to 1 is what allows the file to be used or not.
