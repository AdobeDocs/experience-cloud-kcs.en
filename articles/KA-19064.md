# How to run a datastore consistency check via [!DNL oak-run]

## Description

The data store consistency check will report any data store binaries that are missing but are still referenced. The consistency check can be triggered directly by [!DNL Felix] console.<br>
It could be triggered from `MarkSweepGarbageCollector#checkConsistency` Mbean

If the `BlobGC` MBeans are registered in the `MBeanServer` then the following mbean can also be used:

`BlobGCMbean#checkConsistency`

After the consistency check is complete, a message will show the number of binaries reported as missing. If the number is greater than 0, check the logs configured for `org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.plugins.blob .MarkSweepGarbageCollector` for more details on the missing binaries.

Below is an example of how the missing binaries are reported in the logs:

`11:32:39.673 INFO main MarkSweepGarbageCollector.java:600 Consistency check found 1 missing blobs 11:32:39.673 WARN main MarkSweepGarbageCollector.java:602 Consistency check failure in the the blob store : DataStore backed BlobStore org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.plugins.blob.datastore.OakFileDataStore, check missing candidates in file /tmp/gcworkdir-1467352959243/gccand-1467352959243`

Unlike the `/system/console/repositorycheck` UI, the [!DNL oak-run] tool checks the hidden lucene index files under `/oak: index` in addition to the rest of the content paths. `datastorecheck` command of <b>[!DNL oak-run] </b>can be used to execute a consistency check on the datastore. Â The detailed steps on how to execute the command are detailed below:




## Resolution


1. Download [!DNL oak-run] jar 1.8.8 or later version to your AEM server.

3. Place the [!DNL oak-run] jar in the same directory where crx-quickstart is placed else provide the complete path of [!DNL oak-run]-\*.jar while running below command.

4. Run the command below (update the paths to the segmentstore and datastore as per your environment):


`java -jar oak-run-*.jar datastorecheck --consistency --ref --id --fds crx-quickstart/install/org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.plugins.blob.datastore.FileDataStore.config --repoHome crx-quickstart/repository --store crx-quickstart/repository/segmentstore --dump temp --verbose --track`

4. The command would output a datastore consistency check.

Consistency checker for the DataStore can also be used to list all the blob references in the node store and all the blob ids available in the data store. Use the following command:

`$ java-jar oak-run-*.jar datastorecheck --id --ref --consistency \`

`--store | \`

`--s3ds |--fds \`

`--dump \`

`--track`



Provide one or more of the these available options:

`--id` - List all the ids in the data store.

`--ref` - List all the blob references in he node store.

`--consistency` - List all the missing blobs by doing a consistency check.



The following options are optional:

`--store` - Path to the segment store of [!DNL mongo] uri (Required for `--ref` and `--consistency` options above).

`--dump` - Path where to dump the files (Optional). Otherwise, files are dumped in the user `tmp` directory.

`--s3ds` - Path to the `S3DataStore` configuration file.

`--fds` - Path to the `FileDataStore` configuration file (`path` property is mandatory).

`--track` - Path of the local repository home folder (Optional). It places a copy of the downloaded blob ids to be tracked.
