# Use of $ in values while setting up a Classification rule builder rule

## Description




There are use cases when the revenue needs to be populated as the Classification value. It requires the usage of currency symbols, for example, $ for USD.



Usage of USD $2500 - $3000 for regex as the classification value in a rule in the Classification Rule Builder will return an error. This is because the $ symbol denotes the end of the key in Regular Expressions.

## Resolution


Space can be used to escape $. For instance, a space between $ and the number will resolve the issue.

Example: USD $ 2500 - $ 3000
