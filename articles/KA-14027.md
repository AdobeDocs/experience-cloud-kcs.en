# Use of $ in values while setting up a Classification rule builder rule

## Description


There are use cases when the revenue needs to be populated as the Classification value. It requires usage of currency symbol, for example $ for USD.

Usage of USD $2500 - $3000 for regex as the classification value in a rule in the Classification Rule Builder will return an error. This is because $ symbol denotes end of key in Regular Expressions.


## Resolution


Space can be used to escape $. For instance, a space between $ and the number will resolve the issue.

Example: USD $ 2500 - $ 3000
