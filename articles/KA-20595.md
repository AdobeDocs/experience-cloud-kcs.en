How to filter by a variable other than the target variable in Data Repair API (Application Programming Interface)?

Compound filters can be used in Data Repair API. For example, delete `evar3` when `evar2=X`.


## Resolution {#resolution}

Data Repair API allows the filtering of variables other than the target variable. This is not available to all customers. Reach out to Adobe Customer Care for more information.<br>


<u><b>Syntax</b></u>:




```
{"variables": {
    "evarX": {
    "action": "delete",
    "filter": {
        "condition": "contains",
        "matchValue": "String",
        "variable": "evarY"}}}}
```






<b>Note</b>: In case an error is seen related to the syntax of the body variable, add `content-type: application/json` header parameter to the API request.
