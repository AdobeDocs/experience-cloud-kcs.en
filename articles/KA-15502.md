# Adobe Campaign Standard: [!UICONTROL Last Modified By] listed as Anonymous

## Description


It has been noted that under many circumstances in ACS, the [!UICONTROL Last Modified By] field shows up as Anonymous(Nobody) without any way to determine how the record got updated.

This is a limitation in the way that [!DNL Campaign] currently identifies records previously updated by deleted users, anonymous API requests, workflows, etc.


## Resolution


Currently an enhancement (CAMP-42665) has been created to expand on the details of the [!UICONTROL Last Modified By] field.
