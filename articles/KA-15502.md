# Adobe Campaign Standard: Last Modified By listed as Anonymous

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Campaign Standard

<b>Issue</b>
 In Adobe Campaign Standard, the <b>Last Modified By</b> field shows up as *Anonymous* without any way to determine how the record got updated.

<b>Cause</b>
 This is a limitation in the way that Campaign currently identifies records previously updated by deleted users, anonymous API requests, workflows, etc.


## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Solution</b>
Currently an enhancement (CAMP-42665) has been created to expand on the details of the <b>Last Modified By</b> field.
