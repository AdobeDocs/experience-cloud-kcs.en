internal-notes: "Also hacky, but if you don't mind parsing through a json file for the data, the UI makes a request to get that daily data when you load the trend report above you could grab. If you monitor the network calls it should be one with the file name of performance.at.json."

# Activity Reporting - Get Conversion and Impression Data by Date

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
Target
<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
While reviewing the results of a recent A/B test, I've selected the date range, changed the reporting methodology to visits, and exported the resulting data into a Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file. Somehow, I can't seem to find a method to download the reports data by date. Is it not possible with Adobe Target?




## Resolution


We used to have a daily Comma-Separated Values (CSV) report in Target Classic interface, which now is no longer available.

Daily reporting is quite easy to do with Adobe Analytics now, but for Adobe Target, here are the current options:

1. Use the trend view of the reports. Switch to <b>Daily</b> and then <b>Unique Visitors</b> or <b>Conversions</b> as shown here. It isn't a perfect solution, but it can get you some level of daily detail.<br>

2. A bit of a hack, but you could use the performance <b>Application Programming Interface</b> (<b>API)</b> ([http://developers.adobetarget.com/api/#get-ab-performance-report](http://developers.adobetarget.com/api/#get-ab-performance-report)). You can add a `reportInterval` parameter to specify a specific range. This can allow you to make a request for each day and thereby allow you to collect the daily report numbers. Something like below mentioned <b>API call</b> should work once you have your authorization:
