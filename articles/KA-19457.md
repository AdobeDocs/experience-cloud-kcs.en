# "ImportSharedAudience" workflow is failing | Campaign Classic

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

- Adobe Campaign Classic

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

An error occurred on the workflow instance Import audiences from the Adobe Experience Cloud (importSharedAudience) while processing the task load IDs and segments (fileImport).

Error: Too many columns
![](https://adobe.sharepoint.com/sites/D365EntAttachments/account/604485c9-a5ed-e811-a94a-000d3a34e4b0/incident/E-000185882/Fileimport%20Error.png)

## Resolution {#resolution}


To resolve this issue, review the segment data. There are multiple segment IDs with comma-separated values.

There should be one segment ID for each Operator ID. When the data extraction is performed, IT uses a comma (sometimes space as well) as the separator and 1 comma indicates 2 columns.

There is no issue on Campaign's end.Â The issue is with the customer ID as it has an extra space in it. To resolve this issue, fix the extra spaces.
