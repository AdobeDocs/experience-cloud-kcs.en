# "ImportSharedAudience" Workflow is getting failed| Campaign Classic

## Description

<b>Issue :</b>
<br> <br><br>An error occurred on the workflow instance Import audiences from the Adobe Experience Cloud (importSharedAudience) while processing the task Load IDs and segments (fileImport) .

<br>Error: Too many columns :

<br> <br><br>![](https://adobe.sharepoint.com/sites/D365EntAttachments/account/604485c9-a5ed-e811-a94a-000d3a34e4b0/incident/E-000185882/Fileimport%20Error.png)

## Resolution


To resolve this issue, review the segment data,  there are multiple segment IDs with comma-separated values.

 There should be one segment ID for each Operator ID. When the data extraction is performed, IT uses a comma (Sometimes space as well) as the separator and 1 comma means 2 columns. There is no issue on camping's end.

 The issue is with the Customer id as it has an extra space in it, to resolve this issue fix the extra spaces.
