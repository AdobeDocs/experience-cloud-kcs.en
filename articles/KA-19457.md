# "ImportSharedAudience" workflow is failing | Campaign Classic

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Campaign Classic

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

An error occurred on the workflow instance Import audiences from the Adobe Experience Cloud (importSharedAudience) while processing the task load IDs and segments (fileImport).

Error: Too many columns
![](https://adobe.sharepoint.com/sites/D365EntAttachments/account/604485c9-a5ed-e811-a94a-000d3a34e4b0/incident/E-000185882/Fileimport%20Error.png)

## Resolution {#resolution}


The issue is with the customer ID that has an extra space in it. To resolve this issue, review the segment data and fix the extra spaces.

There are multiple segment IDs with comma-separated values.Â There should be one segment ID for each Operator ID. When the data extraction is performed, IT uses a comma (sometimes space as well) as the separator and 1 comma indicates 2 columns.
