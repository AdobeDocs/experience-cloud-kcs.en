# Data Warehouse error: "segment conversion error: No mapping fromStorageID found for variables/marketingchannel"

## Description

Reason for the error "segment conversion error: No mapping fromStorageID found for variables/marketingchannel"

## Resolution


Data Warehouse doesn't support the "Marketing Channel dimension". If this dimension is used in any segment in Data Warehouse, it throws the error.Â Data Warehouse only supports "variables/firsttouchchannel"(First Touch Channel) and "variables/lasttouchchannel"(Last Touch Channel). Use Last Touch Channel instead of Marketing Channel in the segment to be used in Data Warehouse.
