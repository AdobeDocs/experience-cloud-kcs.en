# Limitations of using Slashes in entity.id for [!DNL Recommendations]

## Description


According to the documentation, there is a limitation of `entity.id` not supporting slashes. However, certain implementations may require the use of slashes in order to be compatible or consistent across multiple solutions. What are the limitations with using slashes and are there any alternatives that could be used?


## Resolution


If slashes are used in the Entity IDs, there are 3 things that will not work:

1) The "Delete entity" feature in the [!DNL Recommendations] [!UICONTROL Catalog Search] will not work.

2) The `GET` entity API (GET [https://mc.adobe.io/\](https://mc.adobe.io/ "Click to follow link: https://mc.adobe.io/"){tenantId}/target/recs/entities/{id}) will not work. This is not required for any product functionality

3) The `DELETE` entity API (DELETE 
[https://mc.adobe.io/\](https://mc.adobe.io/ "Click to follow link: https://mc.adobe.io/"){tenantId}/target/recs/entities?ids={ids}) will not work. This is not required for any product functionality

The use slashes in entity IDs is allowed if these limitations are accepted.
