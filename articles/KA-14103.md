# Limitations of using Slashes in entity.id for Recommendations

## Description {#description}




### Issue



Documentation states that the entity.id does not support the slash character - "/"



### Environment



Implementation requires use of slash characters (/) to be compatible or consistent across multiple solutions.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Three things will not function correctly if slashes (/) are used

1. The "Delete entity" feature in the Recommendations Catalog Search will not work.
2. The GET entity API (GET [https://mc.adobe.io/\](https://mc.adobe.io/ "Click to follow link: https://mc.adobe.io/"){tenantId}/target/recs/entities/{id}) will not work. This is not required for any product functionality
3. The DELETE entity API (DELETE [https://mc.adobe.io/\](https://mc.adobe.io/ "Click to follow link: https://mc.adobe.io/"){tenantId}/target/recs/entities?ids={ids}) will not work. This is not required for any product functionality

Slashes in entity.id can be used as long as the three issues above are acceptable to the user
