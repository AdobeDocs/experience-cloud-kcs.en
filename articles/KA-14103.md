# Limitations of using Slashes in entity.id for [!DNL Recommendations]

## Description

<br>Issue<br><br>
Documentation states that the `entity.id` does not support the slash character - "/"
<br><br>Environment<br><br>
Implementation requires use of slash characters (/) to be compatible or consistent across multiple solutions.


## Resolution


Three things will not function correctly if slashes (/) are used

1. The "Delete entity" feature in the [!DNL Recommendations] [!UICONTROL Catalog Search] will not work.
2. The GET entity API (GET [https://mc.adobe.io/\](https://mc.adobe.io/ "Click to follow link: https://mc.adobe.io/"){tenantId}/target/recs/entities/{id}) will not work. This is not required for any product functionality
3. The DELETE entity API (DELETE [https://mc.adobe.io/\](https://mc.adobe.io/ "Click to follow link: https://mc.adobe.io/"){tenantId}/target/recs/entities?ids={ids}) will not work. This is not required for any product functionality

Slashes in entity.id can be used as long as the three issues above are acceptable to the user
