# Is it possible to run a Data Warehouse request for today's date to return the data so far | Analytics

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
<br>Data Warehouse
<br>Â <br><br>

## Resolution


Yes, a Data Warehouse request needs to be created with Hourly Granularity to deliver hourly files for the same date (current day) to return data so far. If Granularity is chosen as Day, it will wait for that day to be over and would deliver the report post that day.
