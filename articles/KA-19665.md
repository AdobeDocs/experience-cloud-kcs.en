# AEP - In [!UICONTROL Monitoring] profile fragments are not updated or created. Success rate not 100%

## Description


When checking the ingestion in the [!UICONTROL Monitoring] section of AEP, profile fragments are not updated or created. The success rate is not 100%.

Ingestion. happens through batch import from an [!DNL Azure Blob] Storage and the Success rate displayed does not show the profile fragment creation or update.

Expectation is that new fragments should be created and the existing profile fragments should be updated and reflected in the overall success rate.


## Resolution


In the case of batches with experience events, expectation is that [!DNL Experience] events in the same dataset are not being counted as replaced or created if they were already ingested from previous batches.  The expectation is that the ingested time-series events should never have the same `_id`.
