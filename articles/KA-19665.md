# AEP: Monitor profile fragments not updated/created, non-100% success


If the profile fragments are not created or updated during the ingestion process in Adobe Experience Platform, it may be due to ingested time-series events having the same _id.

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Experience Platform

<b>Issue</b>
 When checking the ingestion in the Monitoring section of AEP, profile fragments aren't updated nor created, with a non-100% success rate.

Ingestion happens through batch import from an Azure Blob Storage, and the success rate displayed does not show the profile fragment creation nor update.

It's expected that new fragments should be created and the existing profile fragments should be updated and reflected in the overall success rate.


## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Solution</b>
In the case of batches with experience events, the expectation is that Experience events in the same dataset are not being counted as replaced nor created if they were already ingested from previous batches.

The expectation is the ingested time-series events should never have the same `_id`.
