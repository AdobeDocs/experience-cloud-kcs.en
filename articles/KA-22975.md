# Segment didn't evaluate a profile, but Journey still sent an email


If you find that Journey sends out emails even when Segment has not evaluated any profiles, it could be because of a capacity issue. Beyond a certain point, it has to be manually scaled as per your requirement.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Journey Optimizer (AJO)

### Issue/Symptoms

Journey sends emails even when Segment has not evaluated any profiles.

In this case, the audience size is 0, but when targeted from Journey using a read Segment, it is still sending emails.

Following this, the export job ID was checked using the query below:


```
SELECT
Timestamp,
_experience.journeyOrchestration.serviceEvents.segmentExportJob.eventCode AS EVENT_CODE,
_experience.journeyOrchestration.serviceEvents.segmentExportJob.exportSegmentID AS SEGMENT_ID,
_experience.journeyOrchestration.serviceEvents.segmentExportJob.ID AS EXPORTJOB_ID,
_experience.journeyOrchestration.serviceEvents.segmentExportJob.status AS EXPORTJOB_STATUS,
_experience.journeyOrchestration.serviceEvents.segmentExportJob.exportCountTotal AS TOTAL_EXPORTED_PROFILES_COUNT,
_experience.journeyOrchestration.serviceEvents.segmentExportJob.exportCountRealized AS SUCCESS_EXPORTED_PROFILES_COUNT,
_experience.journeyOrchestration.serviceEvents.segmentExportJob.exportCountFailed AS FAILED_EXPORTED_PROFILES_COUNT
FROM
journey_step_events
WHERE
_experience.journeyOrchestration.journey.versionID = '729c3f1d-d945-42e4-961a-06d16ce9e86f' 
AND
_experience.journeyOrchestration.serviceEvents.segmentExportJob.eventType = 'segmenttrigger-orchestrator' order by TIMESTAMP
```


A difference/gain of five Profiles (on a base of 0) between Segments UI & Read Segment in AJO was observed.




## Resolution {#resolution}


This occurs due to a capacity issue. The system scales as much as it can, beyond which manual provisioning is required.

Given how dynamic Profile stores are, a certain minimal deviation between the two counts -- Segments UI and Read Segment in AJO -- is acceptable.

However, as part of an ongoing re-architecture effort, differences between audience size (Segments UI & Read Segment in AJO) should reduce further.

If it still persists, you can attribute it to:

- Segment count changes that happen because of Profile ID graph split/merge.
- GDPR/Hygiene deleting profiles, post Segmentation completion, among others.


### Cause

Underline storage used by materialized segments store provides 10x auto-scaling. However, if processing requires higher scaling, profiles start dropping from this secondary store. Therefore, manual scaling is required to fix this issue.
