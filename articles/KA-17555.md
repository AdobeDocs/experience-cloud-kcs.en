## Resolution {#resolution}


The fusion schema (`xtk:fusion`) should be deleted in process of postupgrade. But in some cases, the schema is still present.

When you query the database as follow, you may see the following records:

To remove the xtk:fusion schema, you need to run the postupgrade tool with the "-force" option:

`nlserver config -postupgrade -allinstances -force`

You should see the following:

If the schema is still present, you can try with the `"-force -repair"` options:

`nlserver config -postupgrade -allinstances -force -repair`

If it still does not work, you may have to remove manually the records from the database.
