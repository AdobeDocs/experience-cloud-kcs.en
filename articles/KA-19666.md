# Automatic mapping failure on boolean fields during data ingestion

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Platform

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

In this example, a CRM data ingestion includes the client's flow with the customers' master record. The record includes boolean flags about the customers' privacy consents.

- The ingestion process is based on a batch import from an S3 bucket.

- On the CRM side, such fields can arrive as integers (0,1) or as strings ("0", "1").

- When ingesting the data, all the boolean type fields have been imported in the target dataset as "FALSE", irrespective of the original fields containing integer value 1 or string value "1".

Expected behaviour:

- The schema-based import from an S3 bucket should properly map integer 1 and string "1" to "TRUE" boolean value.




## Resolution {#resolution}


Boolean 0 or 1 is not supported. You would need to use the mapper functions to convert this to boolean values.
