# AEP - Automatic mapping failure on boolean fields during data ingestion

## Description


In this example, a CRM data ingestion includes the client's flow with the customers' master record. The record includes boolean flags about the customers' privacy consents.

- The ingestion process is based on a batch import from an S3 bucket.
- On the CRM side, such fields can arrive as integers (0,1) or as strings ("0", "1").
- When ingesting the data all the boolean type fields have been imported in the target dataset as "[!DNL FALSE]", no matter the original fields contains integer value 1 or string value "1".


Expected behaviour:

- the schema-based import from an S3 bucket should properly map integer 1 and string "1" to "[!DNL TRUE]" boolean value.





## Resolution


Boolean 0 or 1 is not supported. You would need to use the mapper functions to convert this to boolean values.
