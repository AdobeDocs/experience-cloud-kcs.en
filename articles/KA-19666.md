# Automatic mapping failure on boolean fields during data ingestion


This article addresses the Adobe Experience Platform issue where during a CRM data ingestion, automatic mapping fails on boolean fields, and therefore, requires the use of mapper functions to resolve it.

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Platform

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

In this example, a CRM data ingestion includes a data flow with your customers' master record. This record includes boolean flags about your customers' privacy consents.

- The ingestion process is based on a batch import from an S3 bucket.
- On the CRM side, such fields can arrive as integers (0,1) or as strings (*0*, *1*).
- When ingesting the data, all the boolean type fields have been imported in the target dataset as *FALSE*, irrespective of the original fields containing integer value 1 or string value *1*.


<u>Expected behaviour</u>:

The schema-based import from an S3 bucket should properly map integer 1 and string *1*to a *TRUE* boolean value.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Boolean *0* or *1* is not supported. You need to use the mapper functions to convert this into boolean values.
