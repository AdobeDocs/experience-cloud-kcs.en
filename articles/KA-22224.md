# Dynamic Media Smart Crops are not getting generated

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Dynamic Media Classic

### Issue/Symptoms

Dynamic Media SmartCrops are not being generated on folders where they should be (covered by image profile).


## Resolution {#resolution}


This is caused due to missing `jcr:content` on folder nodes in the tree. You can put these in place by opening the property page from AEM UI for the target folder. Then click on <b>save & close</b> on all intermediate folders in the tree.
