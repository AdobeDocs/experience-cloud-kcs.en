# Dynamic Media Smart Crops are not getting generated

## Description {#description}


<b>Description</b> : Dynamic Media SmartCrops are not being generated on folders where they should be (covered by image profile)


## Resolution {#resolution}


Missing jcr:content on folder nodes in the tree was the cause. Putting those in place by opening property page from AEM UI for the target folder and just click "save & close" on all intermediate folders in the tree addresses the issue.
