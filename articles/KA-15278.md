# Adobe Campaign Standard: Can you add audience using dynamic condition?

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Campaign Standard

<b>Issue</b>
 Can you use a dynamic condition within a delivery to pull in an audience?


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>
The answer is the only way to add a [!DNL Campaign] audience is to use a <b>[!UICONTROL Read Audience]</b> activity in a workflow.

This ability did exist previously for Real-time Customer Data Platform audiences, however this functionality is not longer supported and is to be removed from the application.
