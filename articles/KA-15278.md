# Adobe Campaign Standard: Can I add an audience using a dynamic condition?

## Description


It has been asked if it's possible to use a dynamic condition within a delivery to pull in an audience.


## Resolution


Currently the only way to add a Campaign Audience is to use a [!UICONTROL Read Audience] activity in a workflow.

This ability did exist previously for [!DNL Dataplatform] audiences however this functionality is not longer supported and is to be removed from the application.
