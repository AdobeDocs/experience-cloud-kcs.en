# Substitution of address for transactional messages


This article answers if it is possible to validate the content and structure of a transactional message in Campaign Standard and if the address feature can be substituted.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Campaign Standard (ACS)

### <b>Issues/Symptoms</b>

Is it possible to validate the content and structure of a transactional message? In addition, is a subsequent substitution of the address feature available?


## Resolution {#resolution}


Currently this functionality does not exist for *ACS*. As of now, `CAMP-48419` has been opened as an enhancement for this to be added in a later release.
