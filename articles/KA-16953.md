# Adobe Campaign Standard: Substitution of address for transactional messages

## Description


It has been asked whether or not it is possible to validate the content and structure of a transactional message and if a substitution of address feature was available.


## Resolution


Currently this functionality does not exist for ACS. As such, CAMP-48419 has been opened as an enhancement for this to be added in a later release.
