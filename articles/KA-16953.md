# Substitution of address for transactional messages

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign Standard



<b>Issues/Symptoms</b>
Is it possible to validate the content and structure of a transactional message and is a subsequent substitution of address feature available?


## Resolution


Currently this functionality does not exist for *ACS*. As of now, `CAMP-48419` has been opened as an enhancement for this to be added in a later release.
