# Default GraphQL Query Executor configuration options

## Description {#description}

The latest graphql-java update creates default parser options that could lead to "Denial of Service" InvalidSyntax error while executing GraphQL complex queries. <br><br>These validations were introduced in graphql-java to avoid Denial of Service attacks. 
<br>For context, those limitations are defined in [https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/blob/v20.3/src/main/java/graphql/parser/ParserOptions.java#L35](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/blob/v20.3/src/main/java/graphql/parser/ParserOptions.java#L35)

## Resolution {#resolution}


The issue can be fixed by customers by passing custom parser options if needed following the steps:

- This is valid for very large GraphQL queries that would return a "Denial of Service" InvalidSyntax error, either starting with
    - AEM Cloud Service (limitation introduced with the internal reference SITES-13906 in release 2023.8 and workaround introduced in release 2024.3)
    - AEM 6.5.21 (limitation and workaround introduced with the internal reference SITES-17355)
- This can be overcome by configuring the OSGI Configuration <b>Apache Sling Default GraphQL Query Executor</b> and adjust the values <b>Max Query Tokens</b> and <b>Max Whitespaces Tokens</b> depending on the needs


*<u>This should be done as a last resort and the values should be increased gradually until the needs of the project is met</u>*.
