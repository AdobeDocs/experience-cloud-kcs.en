# Default GraphQL Query Executor configuration options


Learn how to address *Denial of Service*errors in GraphQL queries caused by default parser options in the latest GraphQL Java update.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Experience Manager

### Issue/Symptoms
<br><br>The latest GraphQL-Java update creates default parser options that could lead to *"Denial of Service" InvalidSyntax*error while executing GraphQL complex queries. <br><br>These validations were introduced in GraphQL-Java to avoid Denial of Service attacks. <br><br> <br><br>For context, those limitations are defined in [https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/blob/v20.3/src/main/java/graphql/parser/ParserOptions.java#L35.](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/blob/v20.3/src/main/java/graphql/parser/ParserOptions.java#L35)

## Resolution {#resolution}


You can fix the issue by passing custom parser options by following the given steps:

- This is valid for very large GraphQL queries that would return a *"Denial of Service" InvalidSyntax*error, either starting with:

    

    - AEM Cloud Service (limitation introduced with the internal reference SITES-13906 in release 2023.8 and workaround introduced in release 2024.3) or;
    - AEM 6.5.21 (limitation and workaround introduced with the internal reference SITES-17355)

        
- This can be overcome by configuring the OSGI Configuration <b>Apache Sling Default GraphQL Query Executor</b> and adjust the values <b>Max Query Tokens</b> and <b>Max Whitespaces Tokens</b> depending on the needs.


*<u>This should be done as a last resort and the values should be increased gradually until the needs of the project is met</u>*.
