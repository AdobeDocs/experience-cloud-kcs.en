# Manual copy of database snapshot

## Description {#description}


### Environment

- Adobe Campaign Classic
- Adobe Campaign Standard


### Issue/Symptoms

Is it possible to create a copy of the database, and keep it available for as long as needed?


## Resolution {#resolution}


Daily snapshots are taken automatically for all Campaign instances, and each snapshot is available for 14 days. Once deleted, these cannot be restored by you.

If you want to keep a copy of the database for an extended period of time, reach out to Support. Support will then have TechOps take a manual DB snapshot. These snapshots are available indefinitely and can be removed manually when needed.
