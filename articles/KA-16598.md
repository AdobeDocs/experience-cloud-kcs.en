# Live Stream: Intermittent 503 and 409 errors

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Analytics
- Customer Journey Analytics

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
*Live Stream Application Programming Interface (APIs)* may return 503 and/or 409 errors sometimes. The reason behind these errors is described in the [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/analytics-1.4-apis/blob/master/docs/live-stream-api/troubleshooting.md), it can happen even if *maxConnections* have been specified (409) and have regular flow of hits in the report suites (503).


## Resolution


This could happen mainly due to the <b>Live Stream</b> client connecting/disconnecting repeatedly. This type of client behavior will result in a myriad of issues, as both of the *load balancer* and Application Programming Interface (*API)* endpoints cannot determine whether the client has lost its connection temporarily or permanently. As per our documentation, the client should establish a connection and then continue to read from the stream without disconnecting. If the connection is lost, the client should wait <b>~60 seconds</b> (to allow the load balancer and API to recognize the severed connection) and then attempt to re-establish the connection to the API.
