# Change [!DNL Analytics] classification value set by rule builder

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Analytics

<b>Issue</b>
 How to manually change a key value that has been classified by a set of classifications rules.


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>

The act of trying to manually overwrite a classification value set by a rule set, will trigger a rerun of the classification rules, changing the manual classified value (upload) back to whatever the rule set says it should be.

The only way to overwrite a classifications value being classified by a rule, is to create a new (more specific) rule to classify the key as desired.
