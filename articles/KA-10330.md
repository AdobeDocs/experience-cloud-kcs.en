<b>Issue </b>

 "illegal image size"
<b>Environment</b>

 AEM 6.2 with Dynamic Media
<b>Cause </b>
 The default maximum on the Dynamic Media SaaS environment is 2000,2000 pixels (maxpix)


## Resolution


Navigate to http://host/crx/de/index.jsp#/etc/dam/imageserver/configuration/jcr%3Acontent/settings

 Switch to the Replication tab and select the Replicate button
 Re-test url and verify the image now returns
