# Adobe Campaign Standard: How can I add a Control Type Typology rules

## Description

It has been noted that by default in ACS users are unable to add Control Type typology rules.  The reason for this is to limit the risk of bad scripting or security issues.

## Resolution

Currently this issue is a bug listed under NEO-20498 and the fix will be available in the 20.1 release February 2020.  That said, the only workaround till that time would be to perform a restore from backup of the Campaign instance to the previous version.
