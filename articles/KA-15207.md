# Can we receive default content even if we don’t pass any value in “AC_language” in the REST call?

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
Campaign Standard


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
We have to click on the <b>initialize content variant</b> section to add multiple languages.
  
 In the content section, we have added default and *English-Us*content.
  
 Assuming that we have added the `AC_language` attribute in the event and published it, now in the REST code if we pass `AC_language= en_us` then it will trigger the `en_us` content.

What if we don't pass any value in `AC_language` section? Will we receive default content?


## Resolution


Yes, this is the expected behavior.
 
If there is `AC_language`, and if `AC_language` corresponds to a known variant, then this variant will be used.
 
Otherwise, for all other cases, the *default* variant will be used (if `AC_language` contains an unknown variant name or if `AC_language` is empty or does not exist in the event).
