# Passing no value in “AC_language” in the REST call


If you don't pass any value in the "`AC_language`" section in the REST call or if "`AC_language`" is empty, you will receive the default variant corresponding to "`AC_language`".

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Campaign Standard

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

1. Click on the <b>initialize content variant</b> section to add multiple languages.
2. In the content section, add default and *English-US*content.
3. Let's say we add the `AC_language` attribute in the event and publish it. Now, in the REST code, if we pass `AC_language= en_us` then it will trigger `en_us` content.


However, what happens if we don't pass any value in the `AC_language` section? Will we receive default content?


## Resolution {#resolution}


Yes, this is the expected behavior.
 
If there is `AC_language`, and if `AC_language` corresponds to a known variant, then this variant will be used.
 
Otherwise, for all other cases, the *default* variant will be used (if `AC_language` contains an unknown variant name or if `AC_language` is empty or does not exist in the event).
