# SCR-160012 JS error compile delivery marks recipient unreachable


In 9032 of Adobe Campaign, when a delivery attempts to compile and send to some recipients, a `SCR-160012Â `JS error occurs and marks the recipients as unreachable. As of now, there is no workaround for this issue.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Campaign Classic



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

In 9032 of Campaign, when a delivery attempts to compile and send to some recipients, and if HTML content errors like the one below are hit:


```
SCR-160012 JavaScript: error while evaluating script content htmlContent
```


then the recipient is flagged as unreachable and quarantined.


## Resolution {#resolution}

<b>Workaround</b>
Currently there isn't a way around this issue, other than the workaround to pull the recipients out of quarantine and attempt to resend a delivery.

NEO-23161 has been opened and being investigated by Adobe R&D for a permanent fix in a future release.
