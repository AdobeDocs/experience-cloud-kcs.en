# Adobe Campaign: SCR-160012 JavaScript error when compiling a delivery for recipients marks the recipient as unreachable

## Description


It has been reported in 9032 of [!DNL Campaign] that when a delivery attempts to compile and send to some recipients, if HTML content errors like the one below are hit, the recipient is flagged as unreachable and quarantined.

"SCR-160012 JavaScript: error while evaluating script content htmlContent"




## Resolution


Currently there isn't a way around this other than to pull the recipients out of quarantine and attempt to resend a delivery.

NEO-23161 has been opened and being investigated by Adobe R&D for a permanent fix in a future release.
