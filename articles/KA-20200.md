# Reasons for the sudden change in visitors' "Browsers" and "Browser Types."

## Description

I regularly analyze visitors' "browser type" and "browser." However, these have increased or decreased from one particular period. Why is this?

## Resolution


If the "Browser Type" or "Browser" dimension suddenly changes unlike previous trends from a specific date, it is possible that the latest browser information has not been registered or updated in our internal lookup table. In such cases, data is temporarily stored in the "(unknown version)" dimension item. Note that the lookup table is updated monthly, and the information is correctly identified after the update. Past data is not updated retroactively.
