# AEP - In what order batch data ingestion works?

## Description

In what order batch data ingestion works?<br><br>In other words, in a situation where multiple files usually get ingested per day. When is AEP processing these files what will be the order in which they will be processed? Chronologically?

## Resolution


We always scan through all files in that cloud storage source folder looking at modified timestamps. Any timestamps before the previous scan will be ignored regardless of whether they were read successfully or not in that prior scan.

All files are looked at and picked up on basis of modified timestamps.
