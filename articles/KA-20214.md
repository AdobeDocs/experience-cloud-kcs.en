In what order does batch data ingestion work?

In other words, in a situation where multiple files usually get ingested per day, what is the order in which AEP processes these files? Are these processed chronologically?


## Resolution {#resolution}


We always scan through all files in that cloud storage source folder looking at modified timestamps. Any timestamps before the previous scan will be ignored regardless of whether they were read successfully or not in that prior scan.

All files are looked at and picked up on the basis of modified timestamps.
