# [ACS] Managing incoming SMS Keywords

## Description

<u>Issue Description:</u>

<br>Automatic Reply sent to MO in the External Account of SMS does not work with multiple keywords

## Resolution


<b><u>Objective:</u></b> To set up an external SMS account in ACS with 'Automatic Reply sent to MO.'

<b><u>Environment:</u></b> Adobe Campaign Standard

<b><u>Cause:</u></b>  OOTB Feature

<b><u>Resolution:</u></b>

The 'Automatic Reply sent to MO' has a keyword that the recipients can send to get an auto-reply. The keyword should be a single word. Multiple words with spaces are not allowed. The keyword is only supposed to contain A-Z / 0-9 at the moment. So avoid giving space or tabs or special characters.
