<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign

<b>Issues/Symptoms</b>
Automatic Reply sent to MO in the External Account of SMS does not work with multiple keywords.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The 'Automatic Reply sent to MO' has a keyword that the recipients can send to get an auto-reply. The keyword should be a single word. Multiple words with spaces are not allowed. The keyword is only supposed to contain A-Z / 0-9 at the moment. So avoid using spaces or tabs or special characters.

<b><u>Cause:</u></b>  The OOTB Feature
