# [Tags] What is the difference between the two types of embed code?

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

- Adobe Tags

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Tags used the embed code only included environment ID such as "//assets.adobedtm.com/launch-ENxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.min.js" previously. However, Tags uses the embed code that has an additional path.

What is the difference between the two types of embed code and do I need to update my embed code on the page?


## Resolution {#resolution}


The change of Tags' embed code is due to the limit of the host server. The number of files that can be saved in the same folder is limited, so Tags generates a subfolder for every environment and then publishes the file to the subfolder and then the root folder.

Tags will publish the library file to both the folders for the existing embed codes, so that users don't have to update the embed codes.
