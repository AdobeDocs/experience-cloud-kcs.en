# [Tags]What is the difference between the two types of embed code

## Description

Tags used the embed code only included environment iD such as "//assets.adobedtm.com/launch-ENxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.min.js" previously. However, Tags uses the embed code that has an additional path. <br><br>What is the difference between the two types of embed code and do I need to update my embed code on the page?
<br> 

## Resolution


The change of Tags's embed code is due to the limit of the host server. The number of files that can be saved in the same folder is limited, so Tags generates the subfolder for every environment and then publish the file to the subfolder than the root folder.

Tags will publish the library file to both of the folders for the existing embed codes, so users don't need to update the embed code.
