# Dynamic Media URL response byte-size


Please let us know how we can get the DM asset binary size while displaying original rendition from a url. So that we can provide the DM asset size

## Description {#description}


<b>Description</b> :

Unlike AEM URLs which are static, DynamicMedia URLs are parsed,
 evaluated, and responded to at runtime on the fly.
 e.g. this returns a 400x400 image:

[https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/TechSupport/Backpack?wid=400](https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/TechSupport/Backpack?wid=400)

but if you want it just 1 pixel bigger, you can request:

[https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/TechSupport/Backpack?wid=401](https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/TechSupport/Backpack?wid=401)

if you want the background red, you can request

[https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/TechSupport/Backpack?bgc=255,0,0](https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/TechSupport/Backpack?bgc=255,0,0)

any of such changes will alter the bytesize of the image

 I think the only way to know the size of the image returned is to parse
 the response header "content-length" for any 200 responses.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The header I'm referring to is this:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Length

and I'm sure there is samplecode somewhere out there to extract it, e.g.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48266678/how-to-get-the-content-length-of-the-response-from-a-request-with-fetch

This is not Adobe code, so you might want to find a reliable source of code and use that instead.
