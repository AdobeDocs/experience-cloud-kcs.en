# Journey condition targeting segment does not work


Learn why `inSegment` evaluates segment membership incorrectly.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Journey Optimizer (AJO)

### Issues/Symptoms

A condition in a Journey using an `inSegment` clause did not execute as expected and returns incorrect results:
<br>Journey starts with <b>Read Segment</b> (Segment A)
<br>Journey contains condition with `inSegment` (Segment B)
<br>=======================
<br>Profile does not match condition criteria despite being in Segment B
<br>=======================

## Resolution {#resolution}


`inSegment` evaluates segment membership incorrectly due to different merge policies in <b>Read Segment </b>journeys.

The merge policy needs to be the same for both segments.

Check the merge policy on a segment:

1. Go to <b>Segments</b>.
2. Open the segment and select <b>Edit segment</b>.
3. Click on the gear icon and see the merge policy.


Alternatively, make an API call to check the merge policy ID for the two segments. For steps, refer to [Retrieve a segment definition](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-platform-apis/references/segmentation/#tag/Segment-definitions/operation/retrieveSegmentDefinitionById) in API References in Adobe Experience Platform APIs.


<b>Cause</b>
This can happen if Segment A and Segment B have different merge policies. Make sure that both segments have the same merge policy.
