# Products for recommendations in Target not reflecting in UI

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Target

<b>Issue</b>
 Couldn’t find the product information in the Target UI under the <b>Recommendations</b><b>Catalog Search</b>.

<b>Steps to reproduce:</b>
 When trying to pass the product or content information to Recommendations using the entity attributes via the mbox by referring from the link ([https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/target/using/recommendations/plan-implement.html](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/target/using/recommendations/plan-implement.html "Click to follow link: https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/target/using/recommendations/plan-implement.html")) here.


 See the entity attribute values are getting populated on the AEM page, but couldn’t find the product information in the Target UI under the <b>Recommendations</b><b>Catalog Search</b>.


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>
There is a setting for sending the entity details through mbox which was not enabled for the client.

It is now enabled, but attributes should get into DB first, then in several hours they should be indexed and available in UI.

This setting is enabled form Recommendations Classic, which is not accessible to the users, so the setting can be changed by clientcare only.
