# Campaign Compatibility with Oracle 19c and SHA-256 Encryption

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign or Campaign Classic
- Oracle 19c with SHA-256 encryption

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
- Need to know if Oracle 19c server is compatible with Campaign
- Documentation says v19 is supported but the Oracle 19c driver does not appear in the Campaign compatibility matrix,



## Resolution {#resolution}


- There should be no issues running Oracle 19c with SHA-256 encryption with Campaign.
- Oracle 19c is a rebranded Oracle 12, so any version that supports Oracle 12c should work with Oracle 19c (including the 19c driver).
