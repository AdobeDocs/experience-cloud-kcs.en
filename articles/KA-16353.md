# Campaign Compatibility with Oracle 19c and SHA-256 Encryption


This article discusses the compatibility of Adobe Campaign with the Oracle 19c server.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Campaign or Campaign Classic
- Oracle 19c with SHA-256 encryption


### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Is Oracle 19c server is compatible with Campaign?

Documentation says v19 is supported but the Oracle 19c driver does not appear in the Campaign compatibility matrix.


## Resolution {#resolution}


- There should be no issues running Oracle 19c with SHA-256 encryption with Campaign.
- Oracle 19c is a rebranded Oracle 12, so any version that supports Oracle 12c should work with Oracle 19c (including the 19c driver).
