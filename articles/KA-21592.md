# Is it possible for a customer with an AEP Activation license to use Event Forwarding?

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- Adobe Experience Platform (AEP)
- Real-time Customer Data Platform
- Customer Journey Analytics


<b>Issue</b>
<br><br>AEP - A customer with the 'AEP Activation' license would like to use Event Forwarding, is it possible?<br>

## Resolution {#resolution}


Please note Event Forwarding (via RTCDP Connections) is included in the RTCDP SKUs but not AEP Activation.
You’ll need to purchase RTCDP Connections to achieve your goal.
