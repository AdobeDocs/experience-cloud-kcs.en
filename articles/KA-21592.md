AEP - A customer with the 'AEP Activation' license would like to use Event Forwarding, is it possible?

## Resolution {#resolution}


Please note Event Forwarding (via RTCDP Connections) is included in the RTCDP SKUs but not AEP Activation.
You’ll need to purchase RTCDP Connections to achieve your goal.

*More details on Event Forwarding can be found in [Event Forwarding](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/event-forwarding/overview.html?lang=en) in Experience Platform   Tags.*
