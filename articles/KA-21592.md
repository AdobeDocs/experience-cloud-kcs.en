## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- Experience Platform

<br> <br><b>Issue/Symptom</b><br>AEP - A customer with the 'AEP Activation' license would like to use Event Forwarding, is it possible?

## Resolution {#resolution}


Please note Event Forwarding (via RTCDP Connections) is included in the RTCDP SKUs but not AEP Activation.
You’ll need to purchase RTCDP Connections to achieve your goal.
