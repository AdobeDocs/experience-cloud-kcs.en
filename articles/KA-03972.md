# What permission(s) is needed to allow users to download assets from AEM DAM?

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 AEM 6.x
<b>Question Detail </b>
 You would like to disable the download button in the touch UI, but need to know the permission associated with the download functionality. What permission(s) is needed to allow users to download assets from AEM DAM?


## Resolution


The ability to download assets is associated with the jcr:read permission. In essence, if you can read an asset, you can download the asset. If you want to disable the download button even though there is permission to read the assets, then you will need to overlay this functionality.
