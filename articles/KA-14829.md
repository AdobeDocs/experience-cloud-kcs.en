# Campaign Classic v7 - Purpose and usage of db module pg_stat_statements


Learn about the purpose and use of db (database) module `pg_stat_statements` in Adobe Campaign Classic v7.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Classic v7 (ACC v7)



### Issue/Symptoms

1. What is db module `pg_stat_statements`?

2. Why it is requested to enable by clients?

3. How it is activated?


## Resolution {#resolution}


1. The pg_stat_statements module provides a means for tracking execution statistics of all SQL statements executed by a server.


    The module must be loaded by adding `pg_stat_statements` to `shared_preload_libraries` in `postgresql.conf`, because it requires additional shared memory.


    This means that a server restart is needed to add or remove the module.


    Link [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/pgstatstatements.html](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/pgstatstatements.html)
2. To implement a view type schema on this table which allows us to monitor queries that take long time.


    This way clients will be able to tune those and optimize performance.


    This extension provides metrics on running queries: which are the most frequently run queries, and how long each takes.
3. <b>`pg_stat_statements`</b>

    1. Verify that official PostgreSQL contrib package for the postgres version is installed.


        <br>

        ```
        $ dpkg -l | grep postgres
        postgresql-contrib-9.3
        ```



        <br>

        If not installed, install it.


        <br>

        ```
        $ apt-get install postgresql-contrib-9.3
        ```



        
    2. Change `postgresql.conf` to preload the module on startup.


        Default: `shared_preload_libraries = ''`


        New: `shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'`


        If using both `pg_stat_statements` and `auto_explain`, use <b>ONE</b> record and separate with commas.


        <br>

        ```
        shared_preload_libraries = 'auto_explain,pg_stat_statements'
        ```



        
    3. In the database that you want to monitor, execute `CREATE` query:


        No extension creation required for `auto_explain`, only for `pg_stat_statements`.


        <br>

        ```
        psql
        postgres=# \c mydatabase
        mydatabase=# CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
        ```



        
    4. In the CUSTOMIZED OPTIONS section of `postgresql.conf`, add the lines:


        <br>

        ```
        pg_stat_statements.max = 5000
        pg_stat_statements.track = all
        pg_stat_statements.save = on
        ```


    5. Restart the postgresql service.



    Example: Get top 5 most costly queries in the databases.


    <br>

    ```
    SELECT query, calls, total_time, rows, 100.0*shared_blks_hit/nullif(shared_blks_hit+shared_blks_read,0) AS hit_percent
    from pg_stat_statements as s inner join pg_database as d on d.oid = s.dbid
    where d.datname = 'Database_Name'
    order by total_time desc limit 5;
    ```
