# Status of SMS delivery in nmsBroadLogRcp is not "Received on mobile"


Learn how to fix the issue where the status ofÂ SMS delivery in `nmsBroadLogRcp` is incorrect.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

- Adobe Campaign Classic v7
- Adobe Campaign Classic v8


### Issue/Symptoms

The status of SMS delivery in `nmsBroadLogRcp` doesn't change to "Received on mobile", even if you have received the SMS.

<b>Steps to reproduce:</b>

1. Send a test SMS and check if you receive it.
2. Open the SMS delivery and check the status of your test in the <b>Delivery</b> tab. It shows *Sent*, though it should be "*Received on mobile"*, since you received the SMS.
3. Check the table `nmsProviderMsgId` for your delivery. An entry is present for the delivery id and message id of your test, with the status *Ignored*.



## Resolution {#resolution}


Contact the SMS provider to get the correct *regex*. Once you get the right *regex*, replace it in the external account and start the SMS process again.

### Cause

The status *Ignored* in the `nmsProviderMsgId` table for the same delivery id and message id indicates that the *regex* used in the SMS external account is not correct.
