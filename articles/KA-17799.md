# Analytics | How to delete user who owns published segments

## Description

When attempting to delete an Analytics user, an error message is showing up and the user account is not able to be deleted. How can I delete the user account?

## Resolution


One of the reason is the user account owns some published segments, so we need to transfer the segments to another user or unpublish the segment in advance.

1. Log into Analytics and access to the Segments UI.

2. Click on "Other filters" on the left rail and then check "Show all" filter.

3. Click on "Owners" and then check the user name filter.

4. Click on the "PUBLISHED" column head to show all of the segments with "Yes" status.

5. Transfer all the segments with "Yes" status to another user via Transfer assets. (recommended)

If you have confirmed the segments are not used anymore, then you can unpublish the segments and then delete them.

Notice: For some reason, the segments might not be unpulished, please refer the "Unpublish or delete segments" on the following document. [https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/seg-publish.html?lang=en](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/seg-publish.html?lang=en)
