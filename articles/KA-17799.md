# Analytics | How to delete user who owns published segments

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
Customer Journey Analytics
<br> <br><b>Issue/Symptoms</b><br>When deleting an Analytics user, an error message shows up, and you cannot delete the user account. How to delete the user account?<br>

## Resolution {#resolution}




One reason is that the user account owns some published segments, so we need to transfer them to another user or unpublish them in advance.

1. Log into <b>Analytics</b> and access the <b>Segments UI</b>.
2. Click <b>Other filters</b> on the left rail and check the <b>Show all</b> filter.
3. Click on <b>Owners</b> and check the <b>Username</b> filter.
4. Click on the <b>Published</b> column head to show all segments with *Yes* status.
5. Transfer them to another user via *Transfer assets*. (recommended)


If you have confirmed that you will no longer use the segments, you can unpublish them and delete them.



<b>Notice</b>: For some reason, the segments might not be unpublished. Please refer to the *Unpublish or delete segments* in the following document. [https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/seg-publish.html?lang=en](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/components/segmentation/segmentation-workflow/seg-publish.html?lang=en)
