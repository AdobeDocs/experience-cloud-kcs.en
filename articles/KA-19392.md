# Set a default value in a form field

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign Classic
- Campaign
- Campaign Classic v7
- Campaign v8



<b>Issues/Symptoms</b><br>A default value must be displayed in a field ('Duration') of the delivery form when it is created. When the delivery is made for the first time, the 'Duration' is set to 0, and when an already created delivery is reopened, it changes to 30.

## Resolution {#resolution}


To find the schema in which the column needs a default value, follow the steps given below.

1. Login to the instance and go the desired form. In this case bm:delivery
2. Go to edit tab and then open the XML.
3. duration_ContactCenter was set to '0' this needs to be changed as according to the default value.




<b><u>Cause:</u></b>  User had specified a different default value in the XML of the schema.
