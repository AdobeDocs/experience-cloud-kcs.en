# Set a default value in a form field | ACC


When creating a delivery form in Adobe Campaign Classic, if the default value for the <b>Duration</b> field is not displayed, you can change the value of `duration_ContactCenter` to match the default value. To do this, follow the steps outlined in this article.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Campaign Classic
- Campaign
- Campaign Classic v7
- Campaign v8




### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

A default value must be displayed in the field <b>Duration</b> of the delivery form when it is created. When the delivery is made for the first time, the <b>Duration</b> is set to 0, and when an already created delivery is reopened, it changes to 30.


## Resolution {#resolution}


To find the schema in which the column needs a default value, follow the steps given below.

1. Login to the instance and go to the desired form. In this case `bm:delivery`
2. Go to the <b>edit</b> tab and then open the <b>XML</b>.
3. `duration_ContactCenter` was set to *0,* this needs to be changed according to the default value.




<b><u>Cause:</u></b>  User had specified a different default value in the XML of the schema.
