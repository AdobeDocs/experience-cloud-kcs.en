# Is it possible to hide or delete OOTB delivery templates in ACS

## Description

<br>Is it possible to hide or delete default/OOTB delivery templates from the template view in ACS?<br><br>

<u>Description</u>
When you create a new marketing activity, the first screen in the wizard asks you to select a type or template. Templates allow you to pre-configure specific parameters according to your needs. The template may contain a full or partial configuration of the marketing activity.

The end-user has a simplified interface. When creating a new marketing activity, you just need to select the template you would like to use. There is no need to worry about any technical configurations. This has already been pre-configured by the functional administrator in the template.

For example, in the case of an email template, you can pre-fill the HTML content, the audience, and any other parameter of your delivery: schedule, test profiles, delivery's general properties, the advanced parameters, etc. This allows you to save time when creating a new activity.



For more details on templates, please refer to [https://helpx.adobe.com/in/campaign/standard/start/using/about-templates.html](https://helpx.adobe.com/in/campaign/standard/start/using/about-templates.html)



Few cases have been reported where users have requested to hide the OOTB/Default delivery templates from the templates view section. Only their custom templates are visible for users accessing the templates for delivery creation.






## Resolution

<u><b>Analysis</b></u>
Deleting an OOTB template is not possible, and also, they cannot be hidden/edited/renamed as the properties of OOTB templates are in Read-Only format, hence not editable.

The only way to hide them from view is to configure the template list to pull down the OOTB templates to the bottom-most section of the list.



However, there is a way to filter out the built-in templates and those custom. When creating a new email delivery, Go to [!UICONTROL Change display mode] and Change the method from [!UICONTROL Cards] to [!UICONTROL Lists]. Click on [!UICONTROL Configure list] to add a filter that will help filter out the built-in or non-built templates: Once you click on [!UICONTROL Configure list], you will see the below screen where you can add the Built-in condition: Add the Built-in application condition and click on OK. You can keep the built-in application object column in Ascending order, which would prioritize custom templates having the value “No,” and the templates with the value “Yes” would be shown at the bottom-most of this list.
