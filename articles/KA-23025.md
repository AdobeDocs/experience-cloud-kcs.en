# AEP - Addressable audience in license usage section does not match profiles counts from the home page


Addressable audience in license usage section does not match profiles counts from the home page

## Description {#description}

When in Experience Platform, you may see different numbers in different places, like so:<br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>Total Profiles on Home page:<br><br> <br><br>![](assets/___d78c82e2-aa6d-ee11-8df0-6045bd0065b6___.png)<br><br> <br><br> <br><br>Addressable audience in License usage:<br><br> <br><br>![](assets/___db8c82e2-aa6d-ee11-8df0-6045bd0065b6___.png)

## Resolution {#resolution}


Note the calculation for addressable audience is different from the total profile count.

The addressable audience is what profile has in its store <u>irrespective</u> of any merge policy whereas what we show in any dashboard (like the Total profile box on the Home page) is the profile based on the default merge policy.
