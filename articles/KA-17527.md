# Deleted Tweets still appear in moderation feed

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
Social


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
Deleted tweets still appear in the moderation feed


## Resolution {#resolution}


A deleted tweet always appears in the <b>Unified Moderation</b> after it is pulled into a feed. <b>Social</b> does not do anything to update deleted tweets in the feeds.

If a tweet is deleted from Twitter before it gets pulled into a feed, then it will never appear in the feed. If a tweet is deleted from Twitter after the tweet displays in the <b>Social</b> feed, it remains in the feed.

There is no way to know that a tweet in the moderation feed was deleted until you try to <b>Like</b> or <b>Reply</b> to it in the feed. After that, a failed moderation action message appears, indicating the post is no longer available.
