# Not able to create emails on ACS Instance

## Description


Problem Description =

We have 2 customers who have reported that they get following error:

Erreur : Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'metamodel' of null
 Pile d'exécution : TypeError: Cannot read property 'metamodel' of null
 at Object.onSuccess

When they try to create an email, through home widget, clicking create button in Marketing Activities or through a workflow.
 This issue doesn't impact every user.



STR=

- Login into the instance. Go to Home Page. Click on “Create an Email”. - Error will appear.
- Go to Marketing Activities. Click on Create. Select Email Delivery. - Error will appear.
- Create a workflow. Add a Delivery activity. Open the activity. - Error will appear.



## Resolution


Problem Resolution = The issue seems to be caused by caching in the browser. When the users logged in the instance using incognito mode of another browser, they didn’t face this issue.
