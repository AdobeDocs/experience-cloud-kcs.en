# Avoiding package snapshot issues in AEM

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Experience Manager 6.5



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

The Package Manager creates a snapshot on the installation of a package. The snapshot is a backup of existing nodes and is used for the uninstallation of the package.

The snapshot is stored as `/etc/packages/<PACKAGE_GROUP_NAME>/.snapshot/<PACKAGE_NAME>-<VERSION>.zip.` There is a risk of performance issues due to huge snapshots or an accumulation of old snapshots.


## Resolution {#resolution}


1. Delete old snapshots regularly.

    The snapshots pile up in the repository as AEM does not delete automatically. Regularly check and delete the old snapshot under `/etc/packages//snapshot.` If you delete a snapshot, you can not uninstall the package of this version, but you can remove it.

    
2. Minimize the package filters.

    The snapshot backup consists of existing nodes as specified in the package's filters. A wide range of package filters can cause a large snapshot. Include only the required paths in the package filter. Example: The extensive package filter(filter.xml)

    

    `<`


    ```
    filter root="/content/dam"; mode="merge"/>        In this example, the snapshot includes all nodes under /content/dam.
    ```

 It is too wide.
3. Use the <b>Extract Only</b>Â option.

    The<b> Extract Only</b> option does not create a snapshot. If there is no snapshot, you cannot uninstall the package of this version, but you can remove it.
