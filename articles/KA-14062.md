# Archived Target Activity data missing on Analytics for the A4T activities

## Description {#description}




### Issue/Symtomps



- Customer data missing from Target campaigns in Adobe Analytics.




### Environment

### Root Cause



The activity name is updated to add "deactivated" to the title in Analytics when the campaign is archived.



### Steps to Resolve



- Search wth 'activity name'+'deactvated'
- Should be able to see results in Reports and Analytics and Workspace when including "deactivated" in the search
