# Delivery failure with Messages queued (connection quotas met) error


Learn how to resolve the following error across multiple domains: Deliveries failing with Error: Messages queued (connection quotas met).

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Campaign Classic



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Getting the following error across multiple domains:

*Deliveries failing with Error:
<br>Messages queued (connection quotas met)*


## Resolution {#resolution}


The *quotas met* message indicates that the email delivery is postponed by the MTA because a certain threshold has been reached while sending.

This threshold is set by the MX management rules under <b>Administration</b> `>`  <b>Campaign Management </b>`>`  <b>Non-deliverables Management </b>`>`  <b>Mail rule sets</b>.

It is a safety measure to prevent IP blacklisting.

There’s a possibility that the thresholds are too low, but that’s a question for a deliverability expert to answer.

If the TLS parameter is not set, it will default to the value in the `serverConf.xml` file (`enableTLS`), which is false by default. Though the purpose of TLS is mainly confidentiality, it is possible that this parameter plays a role in deliverability. Connect with a support agent to get clarity.
