# Analytics Marketing Channel Instances on Custom Links

## Description


Do instances of Marketing Channel get counted on custom links (non-page view hits)?


## Resolution


Marketing Channel rules that are based on referrer information WILL cause a Marketing Channel instance on custom links (non-page view hits). However, Marketing Channels based on page URL, included querey strings, will NOT count a Marketing Channel instance on customer links. This is because the referrer is available on custom links for Marketing Channel rules, but the page_url is not.
