# Analytics Marketing Channel Instances on Custom Links


Learn about instances of Marketing Channel and how they get counted on custom links.

## Description {#description}


### Environment
<br>Adobe Analytics<br><br>
### Issue/Symptoms

Do instances of Marketing Channel get counted on custom links (non-page view hits)?


## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Solution</b>
Marketing Channel rules that are based on referrer information <b>will</b> cause a Marketing Channel instance on custom links (non-page view hits).
However, Marketing Channels based on page URL, included query strings, will <b>NOT</b> count a Marketing Channel instance on your links.
This is because the referrer is available on custom links for Marketing Channel rules, but the `page_url` is not.
