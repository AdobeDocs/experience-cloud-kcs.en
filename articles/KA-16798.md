# Formula is incorrect when calculated metrics is created from Workspace

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Analytics
- Customer Journey Analytics

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
Calculated metrics can also be created by selecting metrics from the Workspace freeform table. User can select the set of metricsright click and then select <b>Create Metrics</b>.

Sometimes, the formula of the calculated metrics created is incorrect. For example, if <b>Page Views </b>and <b>Visits</b> are selected (in that order), the formula shows as Visits/Page Views.


## Resolution


The formula of the calculated metric depends on the order, how a metrics is placed on the freeform table and not in the order they are selected. For example, if order of the metrics in the freeform table is OrdersPage Views, formula will be Orders / Page Views /, and if the metrics is placed as Page ViewsOrders, the formula will be Page Views / Orders.
