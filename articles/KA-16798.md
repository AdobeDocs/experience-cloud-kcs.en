# When Calculated Metrics is Created from [!DNL Workspace], the Formula is Incorrect

## Description


Calculated metrics can also be created by selecting metrics from [!DNL Workspace] freeform table. user can select the set of metrics  right click and then select "Create Metrics". Sometimes, the formula of the calculated metrics created is incorrect. For example, if "[!UICONTROL Page Views]" and "[!UICONTROL Visits]" is selected (in that order), the formula shows as Visits/Page Views.


## Resolution


The formula of the calculated metric depends on the order how a metrics is placed on the freeform table and not in the order they are selected. For example, if order of the metrics in the freeform table is  Orders  Page Views, formula will be Orders / Page Views/ If the metrics are places as Page Views  Orders, the formula will be  Page Views / Orders.
