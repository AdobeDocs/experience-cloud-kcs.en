# How to reproduce the Activity Map's "Link Report" on the "[!UICONTROL Freeform table]" in the Adobe Analytics workspace

## Description

I really like and use the Activity Map in the Adobe Analytics application. So, I use the "Link Report" a lot, but I can't figure out how to reproduce it on the "[!UICONTROL Freeform table]" in the Adobe Analytics workspace. What kind of "[!UICONTROL Metrics]" and "[!UICONTROL Dimensions]" can I use to reproduce this?

## Resolution


Here is an example of a sample.

1. First, open a new project in the Adobe Analytics "Workspace" and drop the "[!UICONTROL Freeform table]" from the left rail into the panel. 
2. Next, match the "[!UICONTROL Date Range]" in the panel to the time period you are reporting on in the Activity Map.
3. For the "[!UICONTROL Dimension]", use "[!UICONTROL Activity Map Page]" and "[!UICONTROL Activity Map Link By Region]". Drop the "[!UICONTROL Activity Map Page]" on the [!UICONTROL Freeform table], and then drop the "[!UICONTROL Activity Map Link By Region]" on the page you want to report. The item displayed will be a combination of the "Link ID" and "Region" items displayed in the Activity Map "Link Report". (Example: Link ID=AAA | Region=BBB)
4. Use "Activity Map Instances" for "[!UICONTROL Metrics]". Insert this "Activity Map Instances" into the [!UICONTROL Metrics] drop zone at the top.
5. Now you can reproduce the same values in the "[!UICONTROL Freeform table]" as in the "Link Report".

Note:
But, when you compare the Activity Map's "Link Report" with the "[!UICONTROL Freeform table]", you may find "Link IDs" on the "[!UICONTROL Freeform table]" that are not shown in the "Link Report". This is because the specifications of the Activity Map's "Link Report" and "[!UICONTROL Freeform table]" are different. In the "Link Report", only the link elements that exist at the time the Activity Map is launched and the page is loaded will be reported. On the other hand, in the "[!UICONTROL Freeform table]", all links that have been clicked in the past and measured in the Activity Map will be included in the report, even if the link does not currently exist in the target page. In this case, you need to use the "[!UICONTROL Segment]" or "[!UICONTROL Filter]" function to remove unnecessary items on the "[!UICONTROL Freeform table]".
