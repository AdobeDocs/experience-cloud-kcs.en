# AEM: Notifications for asynchronous jobs remain in Inbox

## Description {#description}


<b>Environments</b>

Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

From AEM 6.5.7 onwards, notifications sent into the inbox (http://localhost:4502/aem/inbox) include many asynchronous jobs, such as `asyncPageMove` and `asyncRollout`, whose descriptions begin with "Async Job."

This article explains the cause and the resolution of this situation.




## Resolution {#resolution}


Select one of the notifications in your inbox and complete it. Repeat the same for each asynchronous job notification.

<b>Cause</b>

From AEM 6.5.7 onwards, AEM processes certain long-running and resource-intensive operations such as page move and MSM rollout as asynchronous jobs. The asynchronous jobs stay active until you complete them from the inbox. The notifications sent into the inbox remain as well.
