# Adobe Experience Manager: Notifications for asynchronous jobs remain in your Inbox

## Description


Since AEM 6.5.7, notifications sent into the inbox (http://localhost:4502/aem/inbox) include many asynchronous jobs, such as asyncPageMove and asyncRollout, whose description begins with "Async Job."
 This article explains the cause and the resolution of this situation.

<b>Environments</b>
 AEM as a Cloud Service, AEM 6.5.7 or later


## Resolution


Select one of the notifications in your inbox and complete it. Repeat the same for each asynchronous job notification.

<b>Cause</b>
Since AEM 6.5.7, AEM processes certain long-running and resource-intensive operations such as page move and MSM Rollout as an asynchronous job. The asynchronous jobs stay active until you complete them from the inbox. The notifications sent into the inbox remain as well.
