# Adobe Experience Manager: Link Adjustment in Launch Pages

## Description {#description}


The cross-links placed within launch pages will be rewritten to the paths under /content/launches. However, there are cases where the links are not rewritten.

 This article explains how AEM adjusts the links in the launch pages.

<b>Environment</b>
 AEM as a Cloud Service, AEM 6.5


## Resolution {#resolution}


The behavior of link conversion varies based on the method of page selection, either including subpages or adding pages individually.

Here is an example of the source page structure:
/content/wknd/us/en/page01
/content/wknd/us/en/page01/page02
/content/wknd/us/en/page01/page02/page03

The cross-links in page02:
`<` a href="/content/wknd/us/en/page01.html"`>` Link1`<` /a`>` 
`<` a href="/content/wknd/us/en/page01/page02.html"`>` Link2`<` /a`>` 
`<` a href="/content/wknd/us/en/page01/page02/page03.html"`>` Link3`<` /a`>`

<b>Including subpages</b>

When creating a launch, selecting "Include subpages" will convert links within those pages to the links under the launch (/content/launches).

Step 1. Select page01 and proceed to the launch creation screen.
Step 2. Enable "Include subpages" for page01 and create the launch.
Step 3. Links within page02 on the launch will all convert to links pointing to pages on the launch.

After links on /content/launches/YYYY/MM/DD/`<` LAUNCH_NAME`>` /content/wknd/us/en/page01/page02:
`<` a href="/content/launches/YYYY/MM/DD/`<` LAUNCH_NAME`>` /content/wknd/us/en/page01.html"`>` Link1`<` /a`>` 
`<` a href="/content/launches/YYYY/MM/DD/`<` LAUNCH_NAME`>` /content/wknd/us/en/page01/page02.html"`>` Link2`<` /a`>` 
`<` a href="/content/launches/YYYY/MM/DD/`<` LAUNCH_NAME`>` /content/wknd/us/en/page01/page02/page03.html"`>` Link3`<` /a`>`

<b>Adding pages individually</b>

For individually added pages, only links to the lower hierarchy will be subject to conversion.

Step 1. Select page01 and proceed to the launch creation screen.
Step 2. Individually add page02 and page03 via "Add Pages".
Step 3. Disable "Include subpages" for each page01, page02, and page03, and create the launch.
Step 4. On page02 within the launch, links that point to the higher hierarchy, such as page01, will not be converted.

After links on /content/launches/YYYY/MM/DD/`<` LAUNCH_NAME`>` /content/wknd/us/en/page01/page02:
`<` a href="/content/wknd/us/en/page01.html"`>` Link1`<` /a`>` Â 
`<` a href="/content/launches/YYYY/MM/DD/`<` LAUNCH_NAME`>` /content/wknd/us/en/page01/page02.html"`>` Link2`<` /a`>` 
`<` a href="/content/launches/YYYY/MM/DD/`<` LAUNCH_NAME`>` /content/wknd/us/en/page01/page02/page03.html"`>` Link3`<` /a`>`
