# Are dimension values in segment conditions case-sensitive?

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Customer Journey Analytics
- Analytics



<b>Issues/Symptoms</b>
Are dimension values in segment conditions case-sensitive?


## Resolution


Dimension values in segment conditions are not case-sensitive.

For example: If a segment condition is set as "Page contains <b>abc</b>" and the Pages report in Analytics has items such as "abc" and "ABC"

When applying this segment to the report, both Page values "abc" and "ABC" will qualify for this segment.
