# "Something went wrong" Error in TouchUI when Viewing an Asset Timeline

## Description

<b>Issue</b>
The AEM `error.log` file has the following timestamp entry:


```
The query read or traversed more than 100000 nodes. To avoid affecting other tasks, processing was stopped.
```



## Resolution

<b>Cause</b><br>This can occur due to an indexing issue, or when <b>cqPayload</b> is very large. <br> <br><b>Solution</b><br>To resolve this issue, you can perform either of these two actions: <br> <br>
1. Reindex `cq:Payload`, or alternatively,


2. Execute the `workflow purge` command.

<br> <br>`cqPayload` indexes <b>all</b> payloads, so it includes all past workflow payloads under `/etc/workflows/instances`.
