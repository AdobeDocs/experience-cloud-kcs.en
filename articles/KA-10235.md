# 'Something went wrong"' in TouchUI when Viewing an Asset Timeline

## Description



```
The AEM error.log file has the following timestamp entry:

The query read or traversed more than 100000 nodes. To avoid affecting other tasks, processing was stopped.
```



## Resolution



```
This can occur due to an indexing issue or cqPayload is very large. To resolve: 

1-Reindex cq:Payload or
2-Execute 'workflow purge'.

cqPayload indexes all payloads hence it includes all past workflow payloads under /etc/workflows/instances.
```
