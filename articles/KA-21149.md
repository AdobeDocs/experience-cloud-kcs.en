# Page unlock option not working

## Description {#description}

When trying to lock/unlock a page via the page sidebar Image 1 one customer is only able to lock it. When they try to unlock it, they see the error Image 2 and the page cannot be unlocked. <br>However, they can lock/unlock the page successfully when trying via the site admin console 3.<br> <br>![](assets/___b57d848c-0b77-ed11-81aa-6045bd006a22___.png)<br>Image 1<br> <br> <br>![](assets/___41e58f92-0b77-ed11-81aa-6045bd006a22___.png)<br>Image 2<br> <br> <br>![](assets/___43e58f92-0b77-ed11-81aa-6045bd006a22___.png)<br>Image 3

## Resolution {#resolution}


The error 1 when unsuccessfully trying to unlock a page appears because the page doesn't include the "cq.shared" client lib.

To fix this the customer needs to put a dependency on this clientlibs to have it loaded for their custom content page.
