## Resolution {#resolution}


The error `[` 1`]`  when unsuccessfully trying to unlock a page appears because the page doesn't include the `cq.shared` client lib.

To fix this, the user needs to put a dependency on the clientlibs mentioned above to have it loaded for their custom content page.
