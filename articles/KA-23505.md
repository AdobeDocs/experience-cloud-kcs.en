## Resolution {#resolution}


A. If you have a package of the deleted path, install it via the Package Manager.

B. If the deleted path is a page in Sites, consider using the "Restore Tree" function. For more information, see the manual Working with Page Versions.

C. If the deleted path is an assets folder and you have the original files, re-upload them via the Assets console.

D. If the contents of the deleted path are significant and there are no other options, raise a support case for a full restore. Please note the limitations as described in the "CAUTION" section of the manual Backup and Restore in AEM as a Cloud Service.

CAUTION: This feature should be used only when there are serious issues with either code or content. The recent data between the time of the restored backup and the present is lost. Staging is also restored to the old version.
