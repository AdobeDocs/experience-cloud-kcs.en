# How to restore a deleted content path in AEM as a Cloud Service


If you need to find different ways to restore a specific content path in Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service, please refer to this article.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

What are the available options to restore a particular content path in AEM as a Cloud Service.


## Resolution {#resolution}


There are a few options to restore the deleted content path in AEM as a Cloud Service depending on the type of path.

1. If the deleted path was a package, install it again using the Package Manager.


2. If the deleted path was a page in Sites, use the *Restore Tree* function. Check out the AEM as a Cloud Service User Guide for [Working with Page Versions](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/sites/authoring/features/page-versions.html) for more information.


3. If the deleted path was an assets folder and the original files are available, re-upload them via the Assets console.


4. If none of the above options work and the contents of the deleted path are significant, raise a support case for a full restore. However, please note the *CAUTION* section of the manual [Backup and Restore in AEM as a Cloud Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/operations/backup.html).

    This feature should only be used when there are serious issues with either code or content. Restoring a backup will result in the loss of recent data between the time of the backup and the present. Staging is also restored to the old version.
