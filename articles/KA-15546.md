# How to enable creating Activities inside a new Brand | Personalization | AEM 6.5

## Description


<b>Issue:</b>

In AEM 6.5, after creating a new Brand, one is not able to create Activities inside the brand. One can create Activities inside the existing "We.Retail" sample Brand.

- Go to [!DNL /aem/start].html
- Open Personalization -- Activities
- Create a Brand
- Open the new Brand and try to create an Activity




<b>Reason:</b>

Because of a missing permission, the node that represents a master brand, (like: /content/campaigns/my_brand/master/jcr:content) does not include two required properties: *cq:template* and *sling:resourceType*.

It means that the node 'master' is not referring to the personalization component as its resourceType and hence it fails to load a [!UICONTROL create] button.








## Resolution


<b>Resolution:</b>

- Go to the configuration [http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr/org.apache.sling.serviceusermapping.impl.ServiceUserMapperImpl.amended targeted-content](http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr/org.apache.sling.serviceusermapping.impl.ServiceUserMapperImpl.amended targeted-content)
- Change the [!UICONTROL permissions] of the value for 'personalization-service' to 1. Screenshot below.
- Create a new Brand after this fix, you shall see the 'Create' button.
- You can then compare the properties of both Brands' master node" (/content/campaigns/my_brand/master/jcr:content )
