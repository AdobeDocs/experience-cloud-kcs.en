# How to enable creating Activities inside a new Brand | AEM 6.5

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Experience Manager

<b>Issue</b>
 In Adobe Experience Manager 6.5, after creating a new Brand, you can't create Activities inside the Brand.

You can create Activities inside the existing Brand (For example: Brand = "We.Retail"):

1. Go to `/aem/start.html`.
2. Open <b>Personalization</b><b>Activities</b>.
3. Create a <b>Brand</b>.
4. Open the new <b>Brand</b> and try to create an <b>Activity</b>.


<b>Cause</b>
 Because of a missing permission, the node that represents a master Brand, (For example: : `/content/campaigns/my_brand/master/jcr:content`) does not include two required properties: `cq:template` and `sling:resourceType`.

 It means that the node `master` is not referring to the personalization component as its `resourceType`, and hence it fails to load a <b>Create</b> button.








## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>
Follow these steps to resolve this issue:

1. Go to the configuration: [http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr/org.apache.sling.serviceusermapping.impl.ServiceUserMapperImpl.amended targeted-content](http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr/org.apache.sling.serviceusermapping.impl.ServiceUserMapperImpl.amended targeted-content).
2. Change the permissions of the value for `personalization-service` to:

    `com.day.cq.cq-personalization:personalization-service=content-writer-service,sling-scripting`

    just as in the screenshot below:![](https://adobe.sharepoint.com/sites/D365EntAttachments/knowledgearticle/How%20to%20enable%20creating%20Activities%20inside%20a%20new%20Brand%20-%20Personalization%20-%20AEM%206-5_19685F9AF794EA11A811000D3A303484/Activity_Brand_Create.jpg)
3. Create a new Brand after this fix, you will see the <b>Create</b> button.
4. You can then compare the properties of both brands' master node:


    ```
    /content/campaigns/my_brand/master/jcr:content
    ```
