How changing *Profile Merge Rules*impact the total segment population.


## Resolution {#resolution}


- Any change in the PMR will recalculate the segment population.
- Historical data will not be retained if existing users don't align with the new PMR. As a result, you might see reduced or increased segment population.
- The Current Authenticated profile option evaluates profiles in real-time, while the Last Authenticated profile option does the evaluation on the backend server. So, after changing the PMR, allow a minimum of 36-48 hours to see the updated segment population.
- Changing the profile option from *No cross-device* to any of the authenticated profile options would require additional userID information in the AAM data collection. Without userID details, segments won't qualify.
- In the case of People Based Destination (PBD) specific PMR, ensure that the correct data source has been selected to keep segments intact with Hashed email IDs.
