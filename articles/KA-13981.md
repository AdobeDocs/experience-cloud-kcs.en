# Impact of changes in [!UICONTROL profile merge rule] on segment population

## Description


How changing [!UICONTROL profile merge rules] impact the total segment population.


## Resolution


- Any change in the PMR will recalculate the segment population.
- Historical data will not be retained if existing users don't align with the new PMR.Â As a result, we might see reduced or increased segment population.
- The [!UICONTROL Current Authenticated profile] option evaluates profiles in real-time, while the [!UICONTROL Last Authenticated profile] option does the evaluation on the backend server. So, after changing the PMR, allow a minimum of 36-48 hours to see the updated segment population.
- Changing the [!UICONTROL profile] option from "No cross-device" to any of the authenticated profile options would require additional customerID information in the AAM data collection. Without customerID details, segments won't qualify.
- In the case of [!UICONTROL People Based Destination] (PBD) specific PMR, ensure that the correct data source has been selected to keep segments intact with Hashed email IDs.
