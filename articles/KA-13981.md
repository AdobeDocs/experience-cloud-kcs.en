# Impact of changes in profile merge rule on segment population

## Description


How changing profile merge rules impact the total segment population.


## Resolution


- Any change in the PMR will recalculate the segment population.
- Historical data will not be retained if existing users don't align with the new PMR.Â As a result, we might see reduced or increased segment population.
- The Current Authenticated profile option evaluates profiles in real-time, while the Last Authenticated profile option does the evaluation on the backend server. So, after changing the PMR, allow a minimum of 36-48 hours to see the updated segment population.
- Changing the profile option from "No cross-device" to any of the authenticated profile options would require additional customerID information in the AAM data collection. Without customerID details, segments won't qualify.
- In the case of People Based Destination (PBD) specific PMR, ensure that the correct data source has been selected to keep segments intact with Hashed email IDs.
