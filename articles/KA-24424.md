# Copy Content Activity is failing


This article addresses an issue encountered during content backflow activities in Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service (AEMaaCS). Users may experience a failure with an error message indicating `javax.jcr.AccessDeniedException` during namespace registration. This issue impacts the ability to copy content between environments, potentially causing delays in development and testing processes.

## Description {#description}


Customers attempting to copy content from one environment to another using AEMaaCS may encounter the following error messages in their logs:


```plaintext
[ ERROR]  Import job failed with message: DistributionException with message: java.lang.IllegalStateException: javax.jcr.AccessDeniedException: Failed to register namespace mapping <namespace> -> <URI>
[ ERROR]  Content Backflow job encountered an unexpected error.
[ ERROR]  com.adobe.granite.contentbackflow.exception.ContentBackflowException: {"code":"UNEXPECTED-100","message":"Content Backflow job encountered an unexpected error.","cause":"Import of package <package>.zip failed!"}
```


This problem usually arises due to insufficient permissions for the service user performing the content copy, specifically the lack of `jcr:namespaceManagement` privilege required to register namespaces.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The resolution for this issue is scheduled to be included in the 2024.06.2 maintenance release, which is expected at the end of June 2024. Until this release is available, it is recommended to break down large content sets into smaller, more granular sets to bypass specific content requiring namespace registration.

<b>Key Points:</b>

- <b>Scheduled Fix</b>: The fix for this issue is included in the 2024.06.2 maintenance release.
- <b>Release Date</b>: Expected at the end of June 2024.
- <b>Temporary Workaround</b>: Break down large content sets into smaller sets to bypass the namespace registration requirement.
