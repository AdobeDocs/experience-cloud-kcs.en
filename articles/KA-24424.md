# Copy Content Activity failure with the javax.jcr.AccessDeniedException error


This article explains why the content backflow job fails with the `javax.jcr.AccessDeniedException` error during namespace registration as the latest maintenance release is yet to be implemented.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

- Adobe Experience Manager
- Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service (AEMaaCS)




### Issue/Symptoms

When attempting to copy content from one environment to another using AEMaaCS, users may encounter the following error messages in the logs:


```plaintext
[ ERROR]  Import job failed with message: DistributionException with message: java.lang.IllegalStateException: javax.jcr.AccessDeniedException: Failed to register namespace mapping <namespace> -> <URI>
[ ERROR]  Content Backflow job encountered an unexpected error.
[ ERROR]  com.adobe.granite.contentbackflow.exception.ContentBackflowException: {"code":"UNEXPECTED-100","message":"Content Backflow job encountered an unexpected error.","cause":"Import of package <package>.zip failed!"}
```





## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Please note:</b>

- <b>Scheduled Fix</b>: The fix for this issue is included in the<b> 2024.06.2 maintenance release.</b>
- <b>Release Date</b>: Expected at the end of June 2024.
- <b>Temporary Workaround</b>: Break down large content sets into smaller sets to bypass the namespace registration requirement.





<br>Cause<br>
This issue occurs due to insufficient permissions for the service user while performing on the content copy, specifically due to the lack of the `jcr:namespaceManagement` privilege required to register namespaces.
