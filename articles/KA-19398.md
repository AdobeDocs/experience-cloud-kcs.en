# Deliveries stuck in "Start as soon as possible", operationMgt in error


Learn how to fix the issue where the deliveries are stuck in <b>Start as soon as possible</b> mode along with the operationMgt error. Fix this by deleting the proofs, so the operationMgt workflow starts running again after a restart.

## Description {#description}


The campaign workflows may get stuck in "Start as soon as possible" when started from the Campaign view.



This workflow shows the error:

scheduler    SCR-160012 JavaScript: error while evaluating script 'operationMgt/scheduler'.


```
scheduler    SOP-330011 Error while executing the method 'SubmitJob' of service 'nms:delivery'.
scheduler   <b>*SQL STRING REDACTED FOR CONTAINING CLIENT INFO</b>*
scheduler    PGS-220000 PostgreSQL error: ERROR:  duplicate key value violates unique constraint "nmsdelivery_id" DETAIL:  Key (ideliveryid)=(70806071) already exists.
```


The delivery with Primary key <b>70806071 </b>(indicated in the error message) did not exist on their instance


## Resolution {#resolution}


Apparently the delivery with Primary key <b>70806071 </b>existed before, but was deleted accidentally.

The proofs are still linked to it (parent delivery). By deleting the proofs, the operationMgt workflow starts running again after a restart, and the workflow runs as well.
