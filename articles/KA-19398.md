# Deliveries stuck in "Start as soon as possible", operationMgt in error

## Description


The campaign workflows may get stuck in "Start as soon as possible" when started from the Campaign view.



This workflow was in error:

scheduler    SCR-160012 JavaScript: error while evaluating script 'operationMgt/scheduler'.
 scheduler    SOP-330011 Error while executing the method 'SubmitJob' of service 'nms:delivery'.
 scheduler   \*\*\*SQL STRING REDACTED FOR CONTAINING CLIENT INFO\*\*\*
 scheduler    PGS-220000 PostgreSQL error: ERROR:  duplicate key value violates unique constraint "nmsdelivery_id" DETAIL:  Key (ideliveryid)=(70806071) already exists.

The delivery with Primary key 70806071 (indicated in the error message) did not exist on their instance


## Resolution


It appeared that the The delivery with Primary key 70806071 existed before,  but got deleted.

It still had proofs linked to it (parent delivery). By deleting the proofs, the operationMgt workflow started running again after a restart, and the workflows started running again.
