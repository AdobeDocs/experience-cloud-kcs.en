# Error while compiling script 'content htmlContent' line 38: missing ; (line='@ include option='NmsTracking'


In Adobe Campaign, if you are unable to send proofs and deliveries after upgrading to build 9346 with tracking enabled, use the default OOTB tracking formula.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Campaign Classic
- Campaign
- Campaign Classic v7




### <b>Issues/Symptoms</b>

Not able to send proofs and deliveries when tracking was enabled, after an upgrade to build 9346.

Deliveries were failing with the error:

*Error while compiling script 'content htmlContent' line 38: missing ; before statement (line='@ include option='NmsTracking_ClickFormula_acxMultiBrand' /// line 149\ ' token='option='NmsTracking_ClickFormula_acxMultiBrand' /// line 149\ '). SCR-#ID# JavaScript: error while compiling script 'content htmlContent'. JST-#ID# Unable to compile script (content htmlContent).*

However, the OOTB tracking click formula worked.


## Resolution {#resolution}


To resolve this issue, the value of `acxMultiBrand` option can be updated to the value of the default tracking formula (that has already been used in the first place).
<b>Cause</b>
The custom tracking clicks formula `acxMultiBrand`Â is no longer in use but might have been activated during the upgrade. While using the Web Analytics Connector, this formula should not be used.
