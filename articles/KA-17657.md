# Error: QUE-370030 - You do not have the rights needed on folder

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign
- Campaign Classic

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
Sometimes, workflows can fail with the following error:


```
QUE-370030 You do not have the rights needed on folder of identifier 85948572 (documents of type 'Workflow (workflow)') to complete the operation.
```



## Resolution {#resolution}


The reason for this is that the operator associated to the workflow does not have write access to a required folder.

To correct this, check where the workflow, that is running, is located (which folder). To do that, go to <b>Administration </b>`>`  <b>Configuration</b> `>`  <b>Data schemas</b> and find the `xtk:folder` schema. Find the folder by the ID in the error, which should be present in the <b>Data</b> tab of the schema. Then configure the list and display *Full name* which will show the location of the folder.

Go to the folder, right-click on it to display properties. Go to the <b>Security</b> tab and check the operator's permissions.
