# Error: QUE-370030 - You do not have the rights needed on folder

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign
- Campaign Classic



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
Sometimes, workflows can fail with the following error:
<br><br> <br><br>QUE-370030 You do not have the rights needed on folder of identifier 85948572 (documents of type 'Workflow (workflow)') to complete the operation. 
<br> <br>

## Resolution {#resolution}


The reason for this is that the operator associated to the workflow does not have write access to a required folder.

To correct this, check where the workflow, that is running, is located (which folder). To do that, go to Administration then go to Configuration then go to Data schemas and find the `xtk:folder` schema. Find the folder by the ID in the error, which should be present in the <b>Data</b> tab of the schema. Then configure the list and display *Full name* which will show the location of the folder.

Go to the folder, right-click on it to display properties. Go to the <b>Security</b> tab and check the operator's permissions.
