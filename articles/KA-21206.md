# SUB-ASSET status displayed for Asset


The <b>SUB-ASSET</b> status corresponds to the situation where your asset has related assets whose *Digital Rights Management* dates have expired. This is a specific scenario case where the main asset itself has expired. This article provides steps to resolve the issue.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Experience Manager
- Experience Manager 6.5
- Experience Manager Assets




### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

While browsing the assets, some assets show a <b>*SUB-ASSET</b>*status:

![](assets/___86abeae8-6e29-ef11-840b-6045bd006704___.png)

What does this mean?


## Resolution {#resolution}


The <b>*SUB-ASSET</b>* status does correspond to when your asset has some <b>related assets</b> for which their *Digital Rights Management* date expired.

This is a specific case of the scenario where the main asset itself expired, documented here:

[https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/assets/administer/drm.html#asset-expiration](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/assets/administer/drm.html?lang=en#asset-expiration)

You can check which related asset is expired by opening the asset's properties *Basic* tab and observing the *red flag* icon:

![](assets/6269940b-b98a-ed11-81ac-6045bd006ce9.png)



The <b>related assets</b> in question are of two kinds:

<u><b>#1 - Asset is a PDF with sub-pages</b></u>

If you have modified your "DAM Update Asset" to extract pages from your PDF, it will create a sub-asset for the document pages.

Each extracted page is an asset, stored under the main asset, in a sub-node/folder named */subassets* and does have metadata properties, including the DRM *Expires* date in the *Advanced*tab.

If that *Expires* date has passed, you will see:

- the <b>*EXPIRED</b>* status for this sub-page/asset when browsing the main PDF subassets (using the top left rail, switch from *Content Only* view to *Subassets*)
- the <b>*SUB-ASSET</b>* status when moving back to the main PDF


This is documented on the following page `[` 0`]` .



<u><b>#2 - Asset has references assets</b></u>

For any type of asset, it is possible to make reference to other assets. The <b>*SUB-ASSET</b>* status is also computed by looking at the *Expires* date of each of these references.

Those references are stored in a property:

`<asset>/jcr:content/related/links/sling:members/sling:resources`

<u>Note:</u>

In the case your asset does have too many references (several thousand), then it might cause some UI performance issues when trying to display the asset properties.

Checking/computing the status of all those references might take too much time, and the request to open the properties will time out.

Having too many references is concerning and needs to be investigated, as it can cause performance issues:

[https://jackrabbit.apache.org/oak/docs/dos_and_donts.html#Large_Multi_Value_Property](https://jackrabbit.apache.org/oak/docs/dos_and_donts.html#Large_Multi_Value_Property)

To fix the issue, if these related references don't bring any value, one can delete the following folder/subnode from CRX/DE:

*/conten<b>t*`/.../<asset>/jcr:content/related/links`



<u><b>#3 - Tips for checking expired assets</b></u>

You can use the following JCR SQL2 query to list all assets in your repository that has an expiry date reached:

`SELECT * FROM [ dam:Asset]  WHERE [ jcr:content/metadata/prism:expirationDate]  < cast('2023-01-02T17:00:00.000Z' as date)`



Change the date to the current time (in GMT format).
