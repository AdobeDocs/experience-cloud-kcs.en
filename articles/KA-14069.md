# Offer level targeting not working for Automated Personalization activities

## Description


Instead of seeing the expected offer as per the setup of the test, users are shown default content in an Automated Personalization activity.


## Resolution


This could be a delivery issue where the selectors for the offers setup in the activity do not match that on the page during content delivery. If this is the case, is suggested that because all the div tags have unique classes, the activity should be created by turning ON "class" site preferences while keeping "id" preference OFF.
