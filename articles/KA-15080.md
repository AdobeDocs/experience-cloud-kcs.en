# Campaign Classic V7 - Does the WebAnalytics account gets ignored for Duplicated Deliveries?

## Description {#description}


A delivery DM123 was created from a standard empty template and selected WebAnalytics account for this Delivery. 

 As a result, the recipient received email with this link:

 http://t.\*\*\*.com/?id=h16e8bf0,1506776c,\*\*\*&acmid=\*\*\*=\*\*\*&utm_source=0&utm_medium=&utm_content=352745324&utm_campaign=

 If a delivery DM345 was created by Duplicating DM123, nothing was modified except for Message Subject.

 The recipient received message with this link:

 http://t.\*\*\*.com/r/?id=h16e880a,150676fb,15070372

 Does it mean that if the user duplicates Delivery into a new one, all <b>WebAnalytics </b>settings made for initial Delivery are ignored and URL enrichment formula will not be applied to the resulting Delivery?


## Resolution {#resolution}


After creating the delivery <b>save the delivery before sending</b>. DM345 was created by Duplicating DM123 and sent without being saved.

​The recipient would then receive the message with the link as the original one.

<b>*Note</b>*: The discrepancy occurred because the delivery was just sent and not saved after duplicating.
