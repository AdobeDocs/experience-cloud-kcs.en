## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Please note the prerequisites:</b>

1. “Cookie” type data source, if there are synced CRM IDs.


OR

“Cross-Device” type data source, if the ID sync is not confirmed.

1. Traits and Segments.


<b>Steps to follow:</b>

1. Format the data in accordance with the guidelines as specified [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/implementation-integration-guides/sending-audience-data/batch-data-transfer-process/inbound-file-contents.html?lang=en). Any file content failing to abide to these guidelines will end up in failed scenarios.
2. Once the file content is ready, name the file as per guidelines [here for S3](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/implementation-integration-guides/sending-audience-data/batch-data-transfer-process/inbound-s3-filenames.html?lang=en) | [here for SFTP](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/implementation-integration-guides/sending-audience-data/batch-data-transfer-process/inbound-ftp-filenames.html?lang=en) .
3. If a user wants to encrypt their files,  [GPG or PGP encryptions](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/implementation-integration-guides/sending-audience-data/batch-data-transfer-process/inbound-file-encryption.html?lang=en) can be used.
4. Lastly, if one wishes to compress their files, only [GZIP format](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/implementation-integration-guides/sending-audience-data/batch-data-transfer-process/inbound-file-compression.html?lang=en) is supported.
5. After aligning all the configurations, upload the fiiles into the Adobe provided Inbound S3 or SFTP locations.


<b>Additional Information:</b>

1. Post creating new traits/segments, wait for 2-3 hours before uploading any data files. This time is needed for the new traits/segments to propagate across all the global servers.
2. Ensure that you are following the UTF-8 charset file formatting for all the data files.
3. Pay special attention to the characters such as TAB, COMMA, DOUBLE QUOTES etc.
4. Ensure that correct encryptions are being used, otherwise the file won’t be read by an AAM server.
5. Post uploading your file, wait for 24hours for the file details to be available under “Onboarding Status Report” and 24 more hours to this data in the traits/segment. In total 48hours to get the uploaded data into the respective traits/segments.


<b>Points to Remember:</b>

1. For CRM IDs which are not synced, segment will not show any data.
2. Non-synced IDs, when sync later, will become part of the segment but to update trait reports, file reupload would be needed.


<b>In case if any assistance is needed from support:</b>

1. Provide Organization details
2. Share Filename to debug
3. Traits and Segments ID
