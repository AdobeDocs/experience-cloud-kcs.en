# Neolane process down Message Center, how to re-create MCSync workflow


The workflows that were used to sync data from the *Message Center Execution Instance* to the *Control Instance*in older builds have deprecated. This article explains how to create new workflows to sync data in the newer builds.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Campaign Classic

### <b>Issue</b>

Some of the neolane processes are down, such as:

- Quarantine import (`quarantineSynch`)
- Event import (`eventSynch`)
- Cost calculation (`budgetMgt`)





## Resolution {#resolution}


The six workflows that were used to sync data from the *Message Center Execution Instance* to *Control Instance* in older builds have been deprecated in newer builds.

These workflows are:

1. Synchronization start (`synchLaunch`)
2. Event import (`eventSynch`)
3. Import of delivery message qualifications (`broadLogMsgSynch`)
4. Import of event delivery logs (`broadLogSynch`)
5. Import of tracked URLs (`trackingUrlSynch`)
6. Import of event tracking logs (`trackingLogSynch`)
7. Quarantine import (`quarantineSynch`)


In the newer build, new archive workflows need to be created for syncing the data.

Follow these steps to do this:

1. Go to your *Execution Instance External Account* and click the <b>Create the archiving workflow</b> button.

    It will create a new workflow of the form “`MCSync_<external account internal name>`”.
2. Stop the old deprecated workflows, and start using the new workflow.
