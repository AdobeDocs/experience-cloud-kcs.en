# Technical implementation guide: Audience Manager with Campaign

## Description


<b>Environments</b>
 Adobe Audience Manager
 Adobe Campaign

<b>Issue</b>
 This technical implementation guide provides information about the reference architecture, ​guidelines, configuration steps and tests that implementation specialists need to follow while integrating Audience Manager with Campaign.



This technical integration guide is intended for Adobe Consultants, Adobe Partners, and other experienced implementation specialists.

Configuring this integration requires a full understanding of the implementation process for each individual solution covered in this guide.

Adobe customers can contact [Adobe Professional Services](http://www.adobe.com/experience-cloud/service-support/professional-services/contact-us.html) or an [Adobe Partner](http://www.adobe.com/experience-cloud/service-support/partners.html) to learn more about this integration.




## Resolution


<b>Integration Overview</b>

The integration makes use of marketing cloud shared audiences and the declared ID functionality within AAM.

<b>Solution Planning And Integration Architecture</b>

A. <u>Pre-requisites (License, Connectivity, Initialization)</u>

1. Marketing Cloud Org provisioned for the customer
2. Adobe Analytics License
3. Adobe Campaign V6 to be upgraded to 8687 or higher (8705 or higher recommended)
4. Adobe Audience Manager License
5. Adobe DTM
6. Adobe Marketing Cloud shared audiences
7. Customer CRM data to be pushed to Adobe Campaign
8. Adobe Campaign v6 has to be connected with the Marketing-Cloud
9. Configure campaign users in the marketing cloud
10. Users should be able to login to Campaign v6 via Adobe ID


B. <u>Implementation Architecture</u>

![1](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/marketing-cloud/how-to/aam-campaign/_jcr_content/main-pars/image/1.png "1")

<b>Installation, Provisioning, and Configuration</b>

A. ​<u>Set-up/ Provisioning</u>

1. Any additional solutions core services provisioning should be done through your Adobe representative.
2. Campaign Provisioning needs to be done by Campaign TechOps.
3. Datasources, destinations in AAM UI, and AAM sFTP should be created/provisioned through your Adobe representative.


B. <u>Solution Implementation</u>

1. Customer CRM

Customer needs to have a system that stores all the CRM data.

This has to be a list of e-mail addresses, combined with a unique hashed ID of this customer.

For example:
*[abc@abcmail.com](mailto:abc@abcmail.com), 1231231j2g3123*
*[xyz@xyzmail.com](mailto:xyz@xyzmail.com), 234234jh23k4jh324*
Where the first column is the e-mail address and the second column the hashed `CRM_ID`.

2. Sync CRM database with Campaign
Customer needs to set up a process where they push their CRM data to Campaign.

The e-mail and `CRM_ID` are the minimum fields to be synced.

3. Make the `CRM_ID` available on the page
This requires the customer to have logged-in.

Upon login, the CMS has to reach out to customer CRM to verify that the password is correct.

At this level, also the unique `CRM_ID` has to be captured and sent to the page, preferably to a datalayer.

4. DTM reads the `CRM_ID`
Configuration is in <b>marketing cloud ID service</b> tool.

The `hashed_email` data element is configured in DTM reading the `CRM_ID` available in the dataLayer.

5. Configure AAM sFTP in Adobe Campaign

The sFTP created for AAM needs to be configured with Adobe Campaign so that Campaign can push and pull segments from AAM.

The sFTP credentials will be provided to you by Adobe Customer Care or your Adobe representative.

During provisioning, both ftp-in and ftp-out locations are provisioned, which are used by campaign to send audiences to AAM and onboard segments from AAM to Campaign, respectively.

![3b](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/marketing-cloud/how-to/aam-campaign/_jcr_content/main-pars/procedure/proc_par/step_801238358/step_par/image_294052277/3b.jpg "3b")

6. Create the Datasources and Destinations with AAM

The Datasources and destinations for the integrations should be created in the AAM UI, if not created already.

If this has been created, the datasource and destination IDs should be used for configuring them in Adobe Campaign UI.

Two datasources should be created: one based on Marketing Cloud ID, and the other based on Declared ID.

The destinations are created in the AAM Admin UI corresponding to each datasource.

This would require involvement from either an AAM consultant or AAM Clientcare.

![4](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/marketing-cloud/how-to/aam-campaign/_jcr_content/main-pars/procedure/proc_par/step_1253393284/step_par/image/4.jpg "4")

7. Configure the Datasources within Adobe Campaign
The datasources are then configured in Adobe Campaign.

Two datasources will be created in Adobe Campaign UI: one based on declared ID or hashed customer ID, and the other based on marketing cloud id or requestor UUID.

The destination ID corresponding to each ID is added in the respective fields.

For example: the destination ID for AAM destination Adobe Campaign - Declared ID is added in the datasource setting with reconciliation key as hashed customer ID.

![6](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/marketing-cloud/how-to/aam-campaign/_jcr_content/main-pars/procedure/proc_par/step_2/step_par/image_1638458013/6.jpg "6")

8. Track user behavior on site
In the below use case, the search keyword used by a customer is captured in *evar2* and a product purchase as a purchase event in Analytics.

The below flow is based on server side forwarding of AA calls to AAM.

On the search page, you capture the “*q*” parameter and put it in a data-element:

![7](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/marketing-cloud/how-to/aam-campaign/_jcr_content/main-pars/procedure/proc_par/step/step_par/image/7.png "7")

![8](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/marketing-cloud/how-to/aam-campaign/_jcr_content/main-pars/procedure/proc_par/step/step_par/image_1229309964/8.png "8")

And you add this to a page load rule where you add the search keyword in *evar2*:

![9](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/marketing-cloud/how-to/aam-campaign/_jcr_content/main-pars/procedure/proc_par/step/step_par/image_1101520568/9.png "9")

![10](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/marketing-cloud/how-to/aam-campaign/_jcr_content/main-pars/procedure/proc_par/step/step_par/image_1732269070/10.png "10")

Then, you also capture the <b>purchase</b> event in analytics on the thank-you page:

![11](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/marketing-cloud/how-to/aam-campaign/_jcr_content/main-pars/procedure/proc_par/step/step_par/image_820759820/11.png "11")

![12](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/marketing-cloud/how-to/aam-campaign/_jcr_content/main-pars/procedure/proc_par/step/step_par/image_2089746081/12.png "12")

![13](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/marketing-cloud/how-to/aam-campaign/_jcr_content/main-pars/procedure/proc_par/step/step_par/image_246379819/13.png "13")

At this point, we are able to track our customers and able to create segments in Audience Manager.

Also, we have assured that both Audience Manager and Campaign are collecting the users with the same `CRM_ID`.

9. Create segments in AAM based on user behavior
Then create the following traits:
For example: *Has searched for Winter*:

![14](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/marketing-cloud/how-to/aam-campaign/_jcr_content/main-pars/procedure/proc_par/step_3/step_par/image/14.png "14")

Has bought a product:

![15](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/marketing-cloud/how-to/aam-campaign/_jcr_content/main-pars/procedure/proc_par/step_3/step_par/image_586892632/15.png "15")

And create your segment:

![16](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/marketing-cloud/how-to/aam-campaign/_jcr_content/main-pars/procedure/proc_par/step_3/step_par/image_1290766177/16.png "16")

You could add recency and frequency settings in the segment rules as per the business use case.

10. Push the segment to Campaign
To share an AMC audience with campaign, the configuration has to be done within Adobe Campaign once the segment is created in AAM.

Start by creating a shared audience within Adobe Campaign and select the AMC segment from the segment list.

Two shared audiences have to be created based on MID and declared ID within campaign.

Once the configuration is completed, the segments can be seen as automatically mapped to the respective destinations within AAM.

11. Share a campaign audience with AAM through AMC
To share a campaign audience with AAM through AMC, the following configuration is required within Adobe Campaign.
Under <b>Administration</b> menu option within the campaign UI, select <b>Production</b><b>Technical workflows</b>.

Click on new technical workflows, drag query, then update shared audience, and then end.

![22](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/marketing-cloud/how-to/aam-campaign/_jcr_content/main-pars/procedure/proc_par/step_1227537358/step_par/image/22.jpg "22")

Double-click on the query and edit it to select a shared audience and datasource.

![23](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/marketing-cloud/how-to/aam-campaign/_jcr_content/main-pars/procedure/proc_par/step_1227537358/step_par/image_1935942559/23.jpg "23")

Create the segment in AMC.

![24](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/marketing-cloud/how-to/aam-campaign/_jcr_content/main-pars/procedure/proc_par/step_1227537358/step_par/image_1628915330/24.jpg "24")

Once created, these segments automatically appear in the AAM UI, under <b>Traits</b><b>All Traits</b><b>Adobe Campaign Traits</b>.

![25](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/marketing-cloud/how-to/aam-campaign/_jcr_content/main-pars/procedure/proc_par/step_1227537358/step_par/image_1749210502/25.jpg "25")

Run the workflow in Adobe Campaign to send the segments to AMC.

Check the audit once completed.

![26](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/marketing-cloud/how-to/aam-campaign/_jcr_content/main-pars/procedure/proc_par/step_1227537358/step_par/image_1319584899/26.jpg "26")

12. Send the e-mail to customers

In campaign, first create a list based on an audience. This is in <b>Lists</b>:

![27](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/marketing-cloud/how-to/aam-campaign/_jcr_content/main-pars/procedure/proc_par/step_237040443/step_par/image/27.png "27")

The popup now allows you to select a marketing cloud audience.

Choose the *search_for_winter_did_not-buy*:

![28](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/marketing-cloud/how-to/aam-campaign/_jcr_content/main-pars/procedure/proc_par/step_237040443/step_par/image_2079452109/28.png "28")

In the campaign workflow, you will now be able to select this list and send a targeted e-mail:

![29](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/marketing-cloud/how-to/aam-campaign/_jcr_content/main-pars/procedure/proc_par/step_237040443/step_par/image_235562431/29.png "29")

![30](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/marketing-cloud/how-to/aam-campaign/_jcr_content/main-pars/procedure/proc_par/step_237040443/step_par/image_1476800968/30.png "30")

<b>​Testing</b>

It is recommended to run a sample workflow making use of a test segment within AAM to check if the integration is working end-to-end.

<b>FAQ</b>

- What settings do I use while creatine datasources in AAM UI?


The following settings are to be used for the Declared ID and MID Datasources respectively.

The integration codes cannot be changed to any other values, or the customer might incur additional costs.

<u>Declared ID</u>

![31](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/marketing-cloud/how-to/aam-campaign/_jcr_content/main-pars/image_1813731842/31.JPG "31")

![32](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/marketing-cloud/how-to/aam-campaign/_jcr_content/main-pars/image_1073807664/32.png "32")

<u>MID</u>

![34](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/marketing-cloud/how-to/aam-campaign/_jcr_content/main-pars/image_1412349623/34.JPG "34")

![35](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/marketing-cloud/how-to/aam-campaign/_jcr_content/main-pars/image_2005851431/35.JPG "35")

- I don't have the <b>Create shared audience</b> option under <b>Lists</b>, what could be the reason?


You might not have logged-in using your Adobe ID to Campaign.

If you logged-in using your Adobe ID, please make sure you have been added to Audience Library product in Marketing Cloud Enterprise Console UI.

- I have shared a segment with AAM, but I don't see it in the AAM UI yet. What could be the reason?


Once the workflow is run, it could take 12-24 hours for the data to be ingested into AAM and an additional 24-48 hours for the reports to be updated in the AAM UI.

If you don't see number under the traits/segments in AAM UI even after 3 days, please get in touch with your AAM consultant. <b>                                   </b>



<b>Best Practices​</b>

1. It is recommended that the AAM and Campaign consultants work together to complete the setup on both ends.
2. It is recommended to use a segment with limited records to test the integration end-to-end.
3. Never map the segments to the Campaign destination from the AAM UI​.
