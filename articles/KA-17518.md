# How to avoid Internet Explorer rendering in compatibility mode

## Description


In the past (6.1 build  8021), the server never explicitly sent user agent compatibility mode headers (X-UA-Compatible) to the web clients. Some pages contained the following meta tag but it did not always work due to tedious IE heuristics, mostly using the console.
` ``meta` `http-equiv``=``"X-UA-Compatible"` `content``=``"IE=Edge"``/`<br><br><br> <br><br><br> <br><br><br>

## Resolution

<br><br>Changes made in build 8021<br><br><br><br> <br><br>
The following HTTP header is now set by default on all requests responded by Tomcat.
`X-UA-Compatible: IE=edge`<br><br><br> <br><br>
This header effectively makes the console and IE render using the latest available algorithms. The update has solved all reported compatibility issues.
<br><br><br><br> <br><br>Restoring old behavior<br><br><br><br> <br><br>
If this new behavior is not wanted, administrators can change the web server configuration as follows:

- <b>To restore the old behavior</b> (no X-UA-Compatible header set by the server), edit /tomcat-7/conf/web.xml of the instance, and add the following lines:

<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br>

| ```filter````     ````filter-name``HttpHeaderFilter/``filter-name````     ````filter-class``com.neolane.jssp.HttpHeaderFilter/``filter-class````+   ``init-param````+     ``param-name``X-UA-Compatible/``param-name````+     ``param-value``/``param-value````+    /``init-param````   ``/``filter``` |
| --- |

 
- <b>To set a different value</b>, also add the lines, but set the desired value inside the added element.
- <b>To restore the default new behavior </b>(X-UA-Compatible: IE=Edge), ensure that this block is not present


Note:

In any event, if you feel the need to perform such changes on any instance, contact the R&D department. It can have complex impacts on all IE clients.


<br><br><br><br> <br><br>Limitations<br><br><br><br> <br><br>
It does not work for delivery previews, since they are not delivered over HTTP by the Adobe Campaign server. It is an embedded IE control into which contains the customized HTML. The http X-UA-Compatible header does not apply, and the embedded IE forces compatibility mode.

For those cases, there are the following work-arounds:

- Add the following meta tag in your delivery's HEAD nodes. You can also use IE=8 depending on your version.

<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br>

|   1   | ```meta` `http-equiv``=``"X-UA-Compatible"` `content``=``"IE=Edge"``/` |
| --- | --- |

 
- Another option is to create a registry key on all workstations running the console:

<br><br>HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\MAIN\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION\nlclient.exe<br><br>(For 32-bit windows, it is HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION)<br><br>Type: DWORD<br><br>Value: 8000 (decimal)<br><br> <br><br>You can experiment with other values like 9000 if you don't even target IE8.<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br>

|   1<br>  2<br>  3<br>  4   | `HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\MAIN\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION\nlclient.exe``(For 32-bit windows, it is HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION )``Type: DWORD` |
