# How to avoid Internet Explorer rendering in compatibility mode

## Description {#description}

<br>Issue<br><br>
Need to stop Internet Explorer from rendering in compatibility mode
<br><br>Environment<br><br>
Campaign Classic version 6.1 build 8021 or later


## Resolution {#resolution}

Cause<br>
In the past (6.1 build  8021), the server never explicitly sent user agent compatibility mode headers (X-UA-Compatible) to the web clients. Some pages contained the following meta tag but it did not always work due to tedious IE heuristics, mostly using the console.


```
meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=Edge"/
```


The following HTTP header is now set by default on all requests responded by Tomcat.


```
X-UA-Compatible: IE=edge
```


This header effectively makes the console and IE render using the latest available algorithms. The update has solved all reported compatibility issues. If this new behavior is unwanted, you can take the following steps to restore the old behavior.
<br>Steps to Resolve<br>

```
To restore old behavior:
Edit /tomcat-7/conf/web.xml of the instance and add the following lines:
filter
     filter-nameHttpHeaderFilter/filter-name
     filter-classcom.neolane.jssp.HttpHeaderFilter/filter-class
     init-param
       param-nameX-UA-Compatible/param-name
     param-value/param-value
  /init-param
/filter
```


<b>To set a different value</b>, add the lines, but set the desired value inside the added element.
<b>To restore the default new behavior</b> (X-UA-Compatible: IE=Edge), ensure that this block is not present

<b>Limitations</b>

It does not work for delivery previews since they are not delivered over HTTP by the Adobe Campaign server. It is an embedded IE control that contains customized HTML. The HTTP X-UA-Compatible header does not apply, and the embedded IE forces compatibility mode.

For those cases, there are the following workarounds:


```
Add the following meta tag in your delivery's HEAD nodes. You can also use IE=8, depending on your version.
meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=Edge"/
```


Another option is to create a registry key on all workstations running the console:


```
HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\MAIN\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION\nlclient.exe
(For 32-bit windows, it is HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION)
Type: DWORD
Value: 8000 (decimal)
```


You can experiment with other values like 9000 if you don't even target IE8.


```
HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\MAIN\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION\nlclient.exe
(For 32-bit windows, it is HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION )
Type: DWORD
```
