# overflow-y: hidden automatically added to landing pages


In Adobe Campaign Classic v7, if you can no longer scroll the published landing page, manually remove `overflow-y: hidden` from the landing page definition.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Campaign Classic v7 build 9359

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

After publishing a long landing page, it can no longer be scrolled.

#### <b>Steps to reproduce:</b>

1. Go to <b>Resources</b> `>`  <b>Online</b> `>`  <b>Web applications</b>.
2. Create a new landing page and under page activity, add HTML with enough content to be able to scroll through it.
3. Publish the landing page.
4. Open it in a browser, and observe that you cannot scroll to see all its content.
5. Open the page activity of the same landing page and check the `<body style>` tag under the <b>Source</b> tab.    
    Observe that `overflow-y: hidden` has automatically been added after publishing.



## Resolution {#resolution}


Manually remove `overflow-y: hidden` from the landing page definition, or upgrade to ACC v7 build 9364.

### <b>Cause</b>

In the landing page's HTML code, `overflow-y: hidden` gets added to the body style of the landing page, which doesn't allow you to scroll. The issue was fixed in ACC v7 build 9364.
