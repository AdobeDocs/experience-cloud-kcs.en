# Push notifications fail due to APNS mapping to APNS_SANDBOX

## Description

<br>Environment<br><br>
- Campaign
- Campaign Classic

<br><br>Issue/Symptoms<br><br>
It has been reported that for push notifications, [!DNL Campaign] will display *100% sent,* but no push notifications make it to the recipients.

One of the reasons found for this is a misconfiguration on the *[!DNL pipelineD*] service, where APNS is mapping to `APNS_SANDBOX`.


## Resolution


The issue was addressed in *CAMP-37240,* which required a configuration change to the [!DNL *pipelineD]* process.

Documented change to `serverConf.xml`:


```
topic endpoint="" name="mccs_push_notifications_feedback" pipelineName=""
        consume endpoint="" group="$(INSTANCE_NAME)_new" pipelineName=""/
      /topic
```
