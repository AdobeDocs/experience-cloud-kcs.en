# Push notifications fail due to APNS mapping to APNS_SANDBOX

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign
- Campaign Classic



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
It has been reported that for push notifications, Campaign will display *100% sent,* but no push notifications make it to the recipients.

One of the reasons found for this is a misconfiguration on the *pipelineD* service, where APNS is mapping to APNS_SANDBOX.


## Resolution


The issue was addressed in *CAMP-37240,* which required a configuration change to the *pipelineD* process.

Documented change to `serverConf.xml`:


```
topic endpoint="" name="mccs_push_notifications_feedback" pipelineName=""
        consume endpoint="" group="$(INSTANCE_NAME)_new" pipelineName=""/
      /topic
```
