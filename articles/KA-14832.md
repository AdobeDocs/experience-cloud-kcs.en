# Push notifications fail due to APNS mapping to APNS_SANDBOX


This articles discusses the issue where push notifications in Adobe Campaign don't make it to the recipients because of a misconfiguration on the pipelineD service.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Campaign
- Campaign Classic




### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

It has been reported that for push notifications, Campaign will display *100% sent,* but no push notifications make it to the recipients.

One of the reasons found for this is a misconfiguration on the *pipelineD* service, where APNS is mapping to APNS_SANDBOX.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The issue was addressed in *CAMP-37240,* which required a configuration change to the *pipelineD* process.

Documented change to `serverConf.xml`:


```
<topic endpoint="" name="mccs_push_notifications_feedback" pipelineName="">
        <consume endpoint="" group="$(INSTANCE_NAME)_new" pipelineName=""/>
      </topic>
```
