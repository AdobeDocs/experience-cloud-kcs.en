# Orders Participation is lower than Orders in Workspace

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Customer Journey Analytics
- Analytics



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
Why does the Orders Participation metric show lower numbers than the default Orders metric?


## Resolution


Workspace uses a calculated metric with visitor participation, whereas the Reports & Analytics report uses visits participation. The bigger difference, though, is that the R&A report uses the persisted value of an evar and adds participation on top of that. In contrast, the Workspace report uses the instance value of the evar and participates in that. This means that Workspace doesn't have as much lookback enabled. It is possible that the evar persistence is longer than the current reporting window, especially at the beginning of the reporting window. Participation now supports a lookback setting, so it is suggested to use that, if possible, in Workspace to make it more closely match what you see in R&A.
