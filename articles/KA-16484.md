# Orders Participation is lower than Orders in Workspace

## Description


Why Orders Participation metric shows lower numbers than default Orders metric?


## Resolution


Workspace uses a calculated metric with visitor participation, whereas the Reports & Analytics report uses visits participation. The bigger difference though is that the R&A report uses the persisted value of an evar and adds participation on top of that, whereas the Workspace report uses the instance value of the evar and does participation on that. This means that Workspace doesn't have as much look back enabled. it is mostly possible that the evar persistence is longer than the current reporting window, especially at the beginning of the reporting window. Participation now supports a lookback setting, so it is suggested to use that if possible in Workspace to make it more closely match what you're seeing in R&A.
