## Description


In ACS, a GET request to REST API to retrieve OrgUnits fails with the following error message:

"RST-360011 An error has occurred - please get in touch with your administrator.

## Resolution


Please try to "re-publish" the data by republishing the data model via [!UICONTROL Administration] | [!UICONTROL Development]Â | [!UICONTROL Publishing] and re-republish the data model. The new service should then be added when completing the step.
