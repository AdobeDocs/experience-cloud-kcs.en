# When sending a follow-up message, the @processed field is empty


If you see that the *@processed*field remains empty on sending a follow-up message, restart the `updateEventsStatus` workflow.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Standard

### Issue/Symptoms

When sending a follow-up message using the steps documented [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-standard/using/communication-channels/transactional-messaging/follow-up-messages.html?lang=en#sending-a-follow-up-message), the *@processed* field is empty.

#### <b>Steps to reproduce</b>

1. Follow the steps to [send a follow-up message](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-standard/using/communication-channels/transactional-messaging/follow-up-messages.html?lang=en#sending-a-follow-up-message) as detailed in our Adobe Campaign Standard Documentation.
2. Run the workflow setup as described in the documentation; no results are queried in the <b>Query</b> activity.
3. After further checks, the *@processed* field didn't have any value.



## Resolution {#resolution}


To resolve this issue, restart the workflow — `updateEventsStatus`.

### Cause

The *@processed* indicator is filled when the `updateEventsStatus` workflow runs. If the workflow is in a paused state, the field remains empty.
