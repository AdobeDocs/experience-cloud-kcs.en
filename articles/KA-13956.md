# Sync error while saving activity in [!DNL Target]

## Description


<b>Issue</b>

When creating a [!DNL Target] activity with custom code in it, sometimes a sync error saying *[!UICONTROL Unable to Sync the] Activity* is received when trying to save the activity.


## Resolution


<b>Troubleshooting</b>

Below are some examples which have caused sync errors.
These are just some examples to try and troubleshoot, but in order to identify the cause, it will require you to debug the code on your own.

Examples of types of sync errors:

1. Size of HTML Custom offer

2. Because of URLs, especially the `src` attribute value in img  html tags

3. URLs not accessible, restricted, or broken

4. Property duplication. If this is the case, then try the following:

a. Delete the property causing issue and create a new property.

b. Refer to the new property in the activity.
