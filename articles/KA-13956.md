# Sync error while saving the activity

## Description


When creating a [!DNL Target] activity with custom code in it, sometimes a Sync error saying "Unable to Sync the Activity" is received when trying to save the activity.


## Resolution


Below are some examples which have caused sync errors. These are just some examples to try and troubleshoot but in order to identify the cause, it will require you to debug the code yourself.

1. Size of the HTML Custom offer

2. Because of URLs, specially the 'src' attribute value in img  html tags

3. URLs not accessible or restricted or broken

4. Property duplication. If this is the case, then try the following:

4.1 Delete the property causing issue and create a new property

4.2 Refer to the new property in the activity
