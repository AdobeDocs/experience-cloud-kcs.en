# How to change the ID prefix of a report suite

## Description

I have changed my company name and can no longer use the ID prefix name I used when creating new report suites. Is it possible to change this?

## Resolution


ID prefixes can be changed by Customer Support. Please share the following information with Customer Support.

ID prefix name: 
Organization (Company) Name:

Notes:
ID prefix naming conventions require a minimum of 3 characters, and numbers are not allowed as the first character. Also, the maximum length of the report suite ID and the ID prefix is 40 bytes, so please consider an appropriate name. Please note that this ID prefix change will be applied from creating a new report suite ID and will not be applied to existing report suite IDs.
