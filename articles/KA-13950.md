# Why MID is present in CDF without VisitorID Service?

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Audience Manager

<b>Issue</b>
 Experience Cloud ID service is not implemented on my website anywhere, but CDF logs are exporting MID/ECID.


## Resolution


<b>Resolution</b>

ECID/MID will be present in CDF, whether it is implemented or not, as this is a default value which AAM generates for every device with every interaction.

This can be turned off from CDF is required.
