# Why [!DNL MID] is present in CDF without VisitorID Service?

## Description


I do not have Experience Cloud ID service implemented on my website anywhere but CDF logs are exporting MID/ECID.


## Resolution


ECID/MID will be present in [!UICONTROL CDF] whether it is implemented or not as this is a default value which AAM generates for every device with every interaction.

This can be turned off from [!UICONTROL CDF] is required.
