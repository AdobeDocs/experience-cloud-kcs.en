# Why MID is present in CDF without VisitorID Service?


Learn how to export MID/Experience Cloud ID in Adobe Audience Manager.

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Audience Manager

<b>Issue/Symptom</b>
 Experience Cloud ID service is not implemented on the website anywhere, but CDF(User Data Feed) logs are exporting MID(Marketing Cloud ID) and ECID(Experience Cloud ID).


## Resolution {#resolution}


ECID/MID will be present in CDF whether it is implemented or not, as this is a default value which AAM(Adobe Audience Manager) generates for every device with every interaction. This can be turned off from CDF is required.
