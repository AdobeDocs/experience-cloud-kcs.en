How to delete an mbox location?

## Resolution


The removal of an mbox location from the drop down visibility is performed automatically within 2 weeks of inactivity. That said, if you create it by mistake or it's just not useful anymore, and is not linked to an active activity or not selected in the meantime, that should be removed by inactivity. That's the expected behaviour.
