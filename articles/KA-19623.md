An mbox location is removed within two weeks of inactivity.

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
Adobe Target<br><b>Issue</b>
How do you delete a mbox location?

## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Solution</b>
The removal of a mboxÂ location from the drop-down visibility is performed automatically within 2 weeks of inactivity.

If you create it by mistake, or it's just not useful anymore, and is not linked to an active activity, or not selected in the meantime-- any of those instances should also be removed by inactivity, which is expected behavior.
