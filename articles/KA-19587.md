# Access issues in Adobe Audience Manager

## Description

Are you having access issues in Audience Manager, despite being granted access via the Admin Console? These steps will help.

## Resolution

The AAM system admin, within the Audience Manager UI itself (not Admin Console), can complete these steps to grant full, escalated admin permissions within the Audience Manager UI. RBAC controls can also be utilized to grant more granular permissions. More details on RBAC available here:Â [https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/features/administration/administration-overview.html?lang=en](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/features/administration/administration-overview.html?lang=en)

<b>Steps to grant AAM System Admin permissions</b>

1. Navigate to [!UICONTROL Administration] > [!UICONTROL Users]
