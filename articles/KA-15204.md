# Campaign Classic V7 - Is SMS sending via AWS SNS supported with Adobe Campaign V6 and above?

## Description


Is SMS sending via AWS SNS supported with Adobe Campaign V6 and above?


## Resolution


- As it stands, integration with AWS SNS has never been tested so it is not supported with Adobe Campaign as of now.
- If AWS SNS can be compatible with SMPP 3.4, then yes, it can be integrated by using the Extended Generic SMPP connector, else it will not be supported.
