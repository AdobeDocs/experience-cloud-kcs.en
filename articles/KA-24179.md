# Audit log does not log any error when OOTB workflow fails


This article explains what to do when encountering an Out-of-the-box (OOTB) or custom workflow in Adobe Campaign Classic v7 in a failed state with no error(s) in the audit log.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Campaign Classic V7

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Out of the Box (OOTB) or Custom workflow is in a failed state, but there is no error while checking the audit log.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

- Check the *runwf*log from the time the workflow ran and failed.
- Most likely, an error occurs on the insert of the log.

    For example: *duplicate key value violates unique constraint* `xtkworkflowlog_id`
- If this is on-premises, fix the sequence issue.
- If the instance is hosted by Adobe, submit a ticket to customer care with the above details.


### <b>Cause</b>

This is caused by the fact that when Adobe Campaign tries to insert the error log into the database, most likely a database error occurs.
