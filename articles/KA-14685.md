# Campaign: JSSPs not returning proper character encoding

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign Classic
- [!DNL Campaign]



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
Sometimes within the header *`ContentType`* an error is thrown as it has not been properly defined. When using JSSPs that the content type is not returning `application/json; charset=utf-8`.


## Resolution


To fix this, add *`ContentType`* in JavaScript before the rest of the code is executed.


```
%
response.setContentType("text/html;charset=utf-8");
%
```




or




```
%
response.setContentType('application/json;charset=utf-8");
%
```


<b>Sample</b>


```
%
response.setContentType('application/json');
var x = {'Element1':'Element2'};
document.write(JSON.stringify(x));
%
```
