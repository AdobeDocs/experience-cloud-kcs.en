# JSSPs not returning proper character encoding


This article explains how to resolve the issue in Campaign Classic where JSSPs are not returning proper character encoding within the header *ContentType*if it hasn't been properly defined.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Campaign Classic

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Sometimes within the header *ContentType*an error is thrown as it has not been properly defined. When using JSSPs, the content type is not returning `application/json; charset=utf-8`.


## Resolution {#resolution}


To fix this, add *ContentType*in JavaScript before the rest of the code is executed.


```
<%
response.setContentType("text/html;charset=utf-8");
%>
```


or


```
<%
response.setContentType('application/json;charset=utf-8");
%>

Sample
```



```
<%
response.setContentType('application/json');
var x = {'Element1':'Element2'};
document.write(JSON.stringify(x));
%>
```
