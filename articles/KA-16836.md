# Adobe Campaign: Is TLS 1.3 Supported?

## Description


It has asked whether or not TLS 1.3 is supported as some domains are now adopting TLS 1.3 as a sending requirement.


## Resolution


Currently TLS 1.3 is not supported.Â  An enhancement has been submitted in NEO-33477 for this to be supported in a later release.
