AEP - How is the AEP data being secured when transmitting out to the different destinations (encryption, authentication

## Resolution {#resolution}


Generally speaking, the support for encryption depends on the type of destination.

For cloud storage destinations we offer optional PGP encryption, for SFTP we support latest key exchange ciphers and we generally disallow older less secure ciphers.

For the rest of the destinations their APIs are usually over https/tls and as clients, we must conform to whatever they support.

Note we do not use unencrypted channels.

Exceptions are on *external* destinations like Facebook, Pinterest etc — where calls *do go over public internet —*but are secured by access tokens + SSL.

We also have other batch destinations where we use SFTP or secure cloud storage to exchange data.



These principles also apply to Adobe destinations - mainly Adobe Target & Adobe Campaign: ie; All calls to these destinations ( Target, Campaign ) happen in a secure / private way:

- For Target, all the data goes via Edge destination publish which happens via a private transport mechanism that goes via networks hosted by Adobe across clouds.
- For Campaign, the data is securely stored and read using Azure storage (private data landing zones). Data transfer happens after secure authentication, via SSL channels,
