# n/a for Lift and Confidence in breakdown reports in Workspace

## Description


The reason for n/a when fetching breakdown reports with Target Experiences in the A4T reports in Analysis Workspace.


## Resolution


Lift andÂ Confidence can only be pulled against the Target experiences dimension. Breakdowns are not supported currently. As segmentation occurs at a different level in our reporting engine, it can be used as a workaround.
