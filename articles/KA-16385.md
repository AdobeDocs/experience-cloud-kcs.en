# n/a for Lift and Confidence in breakdown reports in Workspace

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Analytics

<b>Issue</b>
 How do you get n/a when fetching breakdown reports with Adobe Target Experiences in the A4T reports in Analysis Workspace?


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>
Lift andÂ Confidence can only be pulled against the Target experiences dimension.

Breakdowns are not supported currently.

As segmentation occurs at a different level in our reporting engine, it can be used as a workaround.
