# URL encoding affecting Marketing Channel Processing Rule

## Description

Marketing Channel Processing Rules won't work correctly for conditions using query string parameters if the characters are encoded in the Page URL. For instance, the URL is [https://www.adobe.com?abc=test%3Futm_medium=xyz](https://www.adobe.com?abc=test&amp;utm_medium=xyz) and the condition uses the query string parameter utm_medium.

## Resolution

The Marketing Channel Processing System does not decode the query string parameters in the URL. It assumes that the intended value is encoded and passed to Adobe Analytics. For the above example, the Processing Rule won't find any query string parameter &utm_medium as the URL contains %3Futm_medium and won't execute any conditions based on that parameter.<br> <br>The implementation needs to be checked to ensure the parameters are decoded before sending to Adobe Analytics.
