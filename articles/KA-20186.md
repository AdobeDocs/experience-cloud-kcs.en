# URL encoding is affecting Marketing Channel Processing Rules


Explore how to overcome challenges in Marketing Channel Processing Roles with encoded query string parameters.

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Analytics

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Marketing Channel Processing Rules won't work correctly for conditions using query string parameters if the characters are encoded in the Page URL. For instance, the URL is [https://www.adobe.com?abc=test%3Futm_medium=xyz](https://www.adobe.com?abc=test&amp;utm_medium=xyz) and the condition uses the query string parameter `utm_medium`.


## Resolution {#resolution}

The Marketing Channel Processing System does not decode the query string parameters in the URL. It assumes that the intended value is encoded and passed to Adobe Analytics. For the above example, the Processing Rule won't find any query string parameter `&utm_medium` as the URL contains `%3Futm_medium` and won't execute any conditions based on that parameter.<br> <br>The implementation needs to be checked to ensure the parameters are decoded before sending to Adobe Analytics.
