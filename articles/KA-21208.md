# Adobe Journey Optimizer: placements in subject line do not load


Learn what happens when you put HTML in the subject line.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Journey Optimizer (AJO)

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Placements are not loading in the drop-down within the<b> Email Designer</b> `>`  <b> Subject Line </b> `>`  <b>Offer decisions</b>. This occurs with any journey that contains an email action.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Create or use an existing TEXT placement for the subject line. This should look something like:

{{{offer.text.`[` xcore:offer-placement:`<` id`>` `]` .`[` xcore:offer-activity:`<` id`>` `]` .content}}}

To check the content type for the placement and/or create a text placement, refer to [Create placements](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer/using/offer-decisioning/create-components/creating-placements.html) on the Journey Optimizer Guide.
<b>Cause</b>
You cannot put HTML in the subject line, only text. Only offers for content type TEXT are displayed.
