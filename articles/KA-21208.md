# Adobe Journey Optimizer: placements in subject line do not load

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
Adobe Journey Optimizer (AJO)


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
Placements are not loading in the drop-down within the Email Designer  <b> Subject Line </b><b>Offer decisions</b>. This occurs with any journey that contains an email action.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Create or use an existing TEXT placement for the subject line. This should look something like:

{{{offer.text.xcore:offer-placement:id.xcore:offer-activity:id.content}}}

To check the content type for the placement and/or create a text placement, refer to [Create placements](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer/using/offer-decisioning/create-components/creating-placements.html) on the Journey Optimizer Guide.


<b>Cause</b>
You cannot put HTML in the subject line, only text. Only offers for content type TEXT are displayed.
