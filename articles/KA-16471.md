# Audience creation options


When creating an Adobe Experience Cloud audience, there are three options. Two of the options offer near real-time qualification, and the other is used for long-term behavior qualification as discussed further in this article.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Audience Manager

### Issue

This page reviews the options for Adobe Experience Cloud audience creation and gives general advice for common use cases.


## Resolution {#resolution}


When deciding how to create an audience, consider the following questions:

- What is your overall comfort level and experience with the interface?
- What is the intended use of the audience?
- What are the timing and portability requirements for this audience?


After considering the above, determine which of the following questions you're asking:

- <b>*Is</b>* the person...
- <b>*Did</b>* the person just...
- <b>*Has</b>* the person recently...


The following table provides guidelines on where the audience is created based on the above question.


| <b>Target</b> | <b>AAM/Audience</b> | <b>Analytics</b> |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *IS* the person... | *Did* the person just... | *Has* the person recently... |


### A. Solution audiences

Solution audiences are still the quickest way to action upon profile data.

If you are asking questions like, "Is the person a new or returning visitor?" or "Is the person using a mobile device?", creating your audience inside the solution gives you the fastest way to action on this data.

### B. Real-time audiences (Audience Library / Audience Manager)

A real-time audience can be created in either the Audience Library interface or the Audience Manager interface (assuming you have access to Adobe Audience Manager).

These audiences are best used to answer questions around "Did the person just...".

Example questions that real-time audiences are best used to answer could be, "Did the person add something to their cart?" or "Did the person finish an application form?".

<u>AUDIENCE LIBRARY</u>

Audience Library audiences are best for:

- Audiences based on eVars, Props, or events for next page targeting scenarios
- Combinations of audiences shared from different solutions (composite audiences)


*Note:* Composite audience latency is equal to the latency of the slowest audiences used in the composite audience.

<u>AUDIENCE MANAGER</u>

Audience Manager audiences are best for

- Combinations of first-, second-, and third-party signals
    - CRM data
    - Partner data
    - Matching services
- External syndication (sending audiences outside the Experience Cloud)
- Algorithmic modeling


*Note:* When using third-party data with Audience Manager, some scenarios can let you action on the first page instead of the following page. To learn more, contact your Adobe representative.

### C. Historical audiences (Analytics shared segment)

Since historical audiences are subject to a 24-48 hour latency starting at the time of qualification, they are best used to answer questions around recent behavior.

If you are asking questions like, "Has the person recently abandoned my site?" or "Has the person searched or viewed a product within the last few days?", historical audiences is your best option.

<u>ANALYTICS</u>

Analytics shared audiences are best for:

- Advanced segmentation or optimization for returning or infrequent visitors
- Audiences that are not time sensitive (up to a 48-hour delay)
- Audiences requiring conditions that other solutions either can't do or are more difficult to do
    - Post-processing variables
    - Processing rule based
    - Complex pathing based


### <b>Summary</b>

An overview of the pros and cons, latency conditions, customer attributes eligibility, and limits is outlined in the table below:
