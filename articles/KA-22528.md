# Nginx potential vulnerability

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Campaign Classic



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Some security issues are reported while using an older version of Nginx (open-source web server software). The potential vulnerabilities are enabling excessive memory consumption and CPU usage. It's strongly recommended to use one of the latest versions of Nginx.


## Resolution {#resolution}


After checking with the Engineering team, it is clear that Nginx is not used on ACC (Adobe Campaign Classic) servers. Therefore, it will not have any impact on memory consumption and CPU usage.
