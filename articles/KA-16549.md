# Username and password do not match on login

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
Adobe Experience Manager 6.x


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
When trying to log in to AEM, the error *Username and password do not match* is returned in a red box on the login screen.

When inspecting the network traffic via a browser debugger, a *403 error*response is returned from an Ajax HTTP POST request to this URL:
 /libs/granite/core/content/login.html/j_security_check.


## Resolution


To debug and fix this issue, follow the guide below:

<b>Analysis</b>

<b>Step 1</b>: Validate the username, password, and that the user exists:

If the issue only happens with one or a few users, then it could be that the wrong usernames or passwords are being used or the users don't exist in AEM.

Check the password:

1. Use Chrome browser and open the [Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools) and select the Network tab in the browser. Then, attempt to log in again.
2. Select the POST request ending with` j_security_check `in the URL.
3. In the lower-right panel of the Headers tab, scroll to the bottom.
4. Validate that under Form Data, the password being sent in the` j_password `parameter is correct.


Validate that the user exists and reset the password:

1. Log in as the admin user.
2. Go to the [user administration](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-65/administering/home.html?topic=/experience-manager/6-5/sites/administering/morehelp/security.ug.js) screen.
3. Verify that the users exist.
4. Create the user if it doesn't exist or reset the password if it does.


<b>Step 2</b>: Analyze broken authentication handling

If none of the above solves the problem, then:

1. Log in to the AEM server's OS.
2. Tail or view the` error.log` file.
3. View the updates to the log while attempting to log in to AEM.
4. If any errors or warnings are logged, then analyze those warnings.  If nothing is logged, then [enable a debug log](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-65/deploying/configuring/configure-logging.html) with these settings:

    


    ```
    Log Level: Debug    Log File: auth-debug.log    Loggers:    org.apache.sling.auth
    com.adobe.granite.auth
    com.day.crx.security.token
    ```
5. At this point, if you are unable to analyze the log messages, and find the root cause, then contact [AEM Customer Support](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/?support-solution=Experience+Manager#support).



<b>Cause</b>
The username or password could be incorrect, or there could be an error from the authentication handler during login.
