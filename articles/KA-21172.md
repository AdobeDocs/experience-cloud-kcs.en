# Contribution is Limited to 1000 Assets Per Folder in AEM Nodes

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
Experience Manager Assets


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
AEM Assets has the limitation of 1000 assets per folder. This is due to the way the nodes are built in the JCR.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Note that the Assets Sizing Guide should be used as a guideline to start with 0. Although usually ordered folder does have the performance overhead and should be  1000 assets as a general high-level best practice. For larger numbers, have a look at unordered folders only.

OAK recommends using \*un-orderable\* node type to scale large number of child nodes 1. Use `sling:Folder` node type instead of `sling:orderedFolder`.
