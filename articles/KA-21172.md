# Contribution is Limited to 1000 Assets Per Folder in AEM Nodes


If contribution is limited to 1000 assets per folder in AEM nodes, OAK recommends using \*un-orderable\* node type to scale large number of child nodes.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Experience Manager Assets



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

AEM Assets has the limitation of 1000 assets per folder. This is due to the way the nodes are built in the JCR.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Note that the Assets Sizing Guide should be used as a guideline to start with `[` 0`]` . Although, usually ordered folder does have the performance overhead and should be `<`  1000 assets as a general high-level best practice. For larger numbers, have a look at unordered folders only.

OAK recommends using \*un-orderable\* node type to scale large number of child nodes `[` 1`]` . Use `sling:Folder` node type instead of `sling:orderedFolder`.
