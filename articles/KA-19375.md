# How to resolve host name could not be resolved under 'Shared Audiences Import Workflow'

## Description

You set up a [!UICONTROL Shared Audiences] Import Workflow to import data from AAM (Adobe Audience Manager). It fails with the error "Couldn't resolve hostname" when you run it. 

## Resolution


Try the following steps to resolve the issue

1- Log in to the instance  /Click on Adobe Campaign Power Button

2- Click [!UICONTROL Administration/Application settings/External accounts]

3- Search for the [!UICONTROL Import Shared Audience] External account

4-Click on it to display its configuration

5- Update configuration/remove AWS Region/Uncheck "keep files in S3 encrypted"/save the change

6- Now go back to Application settings under [!UICONTROL Administration/Click on Workflows/]

7- Search for the [!UICONTROL Import Shared Audience] Technical Workflow

8- Click on it to open it/then restart it

9- Check Log and tasks

<b>The result should be OK</b> -  *Note that*y*ou may get a "No file to transfer found" error if there is no file to import from the remote host. However, the original issue of  "could not resolve hostname" is fixed.*
