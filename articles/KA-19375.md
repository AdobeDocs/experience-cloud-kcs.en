# How to resolve host name which could not be resolved under 'Shared Audiences Import Workflow'

## Description {#description}

A Shared Audiences Import Workflow has been to import data from AAM (Adobe Audience Manager). It fails with the error "Couldn't resolve hostname" when it is run.

## Resolution {#resolution}


Try the following steps to resolve the issue

1. Log in to the instance  /Click on Adobe Campaign Power Button
2. Click Administration/Application settings/External accounts
3. Search for the Import Shared Audience External account
4. Click on it to display its configuration
5. Update configuration/remove AWS Region/Uncheck "keep files in S3 encrypted"/save the change
6. Now go back to Application settings under Administration/Click on Workflows/
7. Search for the Import Shared Audience Technical Workflow
8. Click on it to open it/then restart it
9. Check Log and tasks


<b>The result should be OK</b> -  Note that one may get a "*No file to transfer found*" error if there is no file to import from the remote host. However, the original issue "*could not resolve hostname*" is fixed.
