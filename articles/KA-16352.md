# Campaign - ACS Shared Audiences - using VisitorID for push notifications


You can't reconcile <b>ECID</b> from app subscriptions rather than email. Use the <b>ECID</b> as a declared ID. Store the ID in your profile, and create an AMC connection to use for this field for reconciliation.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environments</b>

- Adobe Campaign (AC)
- Adobe Campaign Standard (ACS)


<b>Issue</b>

- Using push notifications, not emails
- Exporting audiences from People Core Service with <b>VisitorID</b>
- No Audience Manager integration so no <b>DeclaredID</b>
- The documentation states that <b>VisitorID</b> is linked to the profile when the user clicks on an email sent via Adobe Campaign but does not mention Push Notifications.
- Need to reconcile a customer with <b>VisitorID</b> using push notifications rather than emails.
- Need to know whether ACS <b>VisitorID</b> Shared Audience reconciles against push notification <b>ECID</b>.
