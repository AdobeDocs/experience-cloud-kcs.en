 Why are Content Starts greater than Media Starts in some scenarios?


## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Solution</b>
This behavior can be caused by one of the following situations:

- There are no context data on Media Starts call sent from the player.

    To fix this, the `s.trackVars` should contain all media context data parameters, or just remove `s.trackVars` (for SDK versions lower than 3.0).
- Mobile SDK or App Measurement is sending hits with timestamp value-added, while the report suite is set to non-timestamp data.

    To fix this, enable the report suite for timestamp optional hits.
- The player runs in a browser that discards tracking calls to our generic endpoints `*.sc.omtrdc.net`.

    To fix this, use first-party domains like `metrics.example.com`.
