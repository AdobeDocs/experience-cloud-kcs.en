# Throttle large email sends in ACS

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Campaign Standard

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

When customers have an email send with a large audience list, they would like to throttle the email send, so that it sends only a certain designated amount per hour (same as waves in Adobe Campaign Classic).


## Resolution {#resolution}


We can use the send time optimization option in ACS to set up throttling for large email sends. This will send emails out over the course of several hours.

To avoid being marked as spam, you can progressively increase the volume sent by distributing large volumes of emails over different times. This should ensure smooth development of the start-up phase and enable you to reduce the overall rate of invalid addresses. For more information, refer to [Computing the sending date](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-standard/using/testing-and-sending/scheduling-messages/computing-the-sending-date.html), in the Adobe Campaign Standard documentation.
