# Throttle large email sends in ACS


To throttle an email send with a large audience list in Adobe Campaign Standard, you may use the <b>Send Time Optimization</b> option.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Campaign Standard

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

When there is an email send with a large audience list, you would like to throttle the email send so that it only sends a certain designated amount per hour (same as waves in Adobe Campaign Classic).


## Resolution {#resolution}


Use the <b>Send Time Optimization</b> option in ACS to set up throttling for large email sends. This will send emails out over the course of several hours.

To avoid being marked as spam, you can progressively increase the volume sent by distributing large volumes of emails over different times. This should ensure smooth development of the start-up phase and enable you to reduce the overall rate of invalid addresses. For more information, refer to [Computing the sending date](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-standard/using/testing-and-sending/scheduling-messages/computing-the-sending-date.html), in the Adobe Campaign Standard documentation.
