Access denied in Assets Essentials.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Before using Adobe Experience Manager Assets Essentials, you must add users to the Assets Essentials Consumer Users or/and Assets Essentials Users Product profiles. For steps, refer to *Add user groups to product profiles* in [Administer Assets Essentials and add users](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-assets-essentials/help/get-started-admins/deploy-administer.html#add-users-to-product-profiles) in the Assets Essentials Guide. When adding the user to the profile, make sure you are adding the user in the <b>Users </b> tab. Adding the user in the <b>Admins</b> tab of the profile would only allow the user to edit the profile in the Admin console. It will not give the user access to Assets Essentials.
