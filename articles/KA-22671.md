# Thumbnail is black on uploaded mp4 video assets

## Description {#description}


### EnvironmentÂ 

Adobe Experience Manager

### Issue/Symptoms

After uploading mp4 files, the generated thumbnails are black.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The thumbnail for a video typically corresponds to its initial frame. In cases where this first frame is predominantly black, it can result in the thumbnail representing an all-black rendition of the video.

A feature enhancement request has been initiated<b> </b>within AEM-CS to enhance the default video thumbnail selection process.

The objective is to avoid selecting black frames as thumbnails and instead opt for more suitable frames that better represent the video content.
