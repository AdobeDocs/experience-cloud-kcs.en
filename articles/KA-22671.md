# Thumbnail is black on uploaded mp4 video assets

## Description {#description}


<b>Description</b> :

After uploading  mp4 files the generated thumbnails are actually a black thumbnail.


## Resolution {#resolution}




The thumbnail will always be the first frame of the video, If the first frame is black this will cause all black renditions.

There is an Improvement Feature Request (internal reference ASSETS-25505) to improve the default video thumbnail behavior in AEM-CS to skip the black frames and pick a more appropriate frame.
