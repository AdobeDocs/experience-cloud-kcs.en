# Thumbnail is black on uploaded mp4 video assets in AEMaaCS


A feature enhancement request has been initiated<b> </b>within AEMaaCS to enhance the default video thumbnail selection process.

## Description {#description}


### EnvironmentÂ 

Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service (AEMaaCS)

### Issue

After uploading mp4 files, the generated thumbnails are black.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The thumbnail for a video typically corresponds to its initial frame. In cases where this first frame is predominantly black, it can result in the thumbnail representing an all-black rendition of the video.

A feature enhancement request has been initiated<b> </b>within AEMaaCS to enhance the default video thumbnail selection process.

The objective is to avoid selecting black frames as thumbnails and instead opt for more suitable frames that better represent the video content.
