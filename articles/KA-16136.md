# Special characters not displaying properly in transactional emails


To ensure that special characters are displaying properly in transactional emails in Campaign Standard, specigy the encoding in the Content-type header of the API call.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Standard (ACS)

### Issue/Symptoms

Transactional email templates have utf-8 character settings.

 Despite this, special characters are not displaying properly when the field is dynamic.

If any static text is there with special characters, it displays as expected.


## Resolution {#resolution}


This can happen because the encoding must be specified in the Content-type header of the API call made to trigger the transactional event:

`Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8`
