# Customer Attributes show as unspecified in Adobe Analytics

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

- Adobe Analytics

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Customer Attributes show as unspecified in Adobe Analytics.


## Resolution {#resolution}




You may see "unspecified" in the cases below. This is working as designed.

1. The Experience Cloud ID (ECID) is mapped to other customer IDs that do not have a valid customer attribute value. This would happen when a machine/browser is used by multiple authenticated users.
2. There are several ECIDs that generated traffic to a customer ID and not all of them are synced in the Experience Cloud (Customer Attributes), whereas the customer ID was collected in an eVar for all the ECIDs. Suppose, for example, three ECIDs 123, 456, and 789 generated traffic to a customer ID. If the ECID 789 is not synced, traffic generated by ECID 789 would show unspecified.
