# [!UICONTROL Customer Attributes] show as [!UICONTROL unspecified] in Adobe Analytics

## Description

Issue/Symptoms
<br>[!UICONTROL Customer Attributes] show as unspecified in Adobe Analytics.

## Resolution




You may see "[!UICONTROL unspecified]" in the cases below. This is working as designed.

1. The Experience Cloud ID (ECID) is mapped to other customer IDs that do not have a valid customer attribute value. This would happen when a machine/browser is used by multiple authenticated users.
2. There are several ECIDs that generated traffic to a customer ID and not all of them are synced in the Experience Cloud ([!UICONTROL Customer Attributes]), whereas the customer ID was collected in an eVar for all the ECIDs. Suppose, for example, three ECIDs 123, 456, and 789 generated traffic to a customer ID. If the ECID 789 is not synced, traffic generated by ECID 789 would show unspecified.
