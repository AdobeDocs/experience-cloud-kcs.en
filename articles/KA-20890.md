# Web Tier Pipeline failing with "Opt-in file //opt-in/USE_SOURCES_DIRECTLY is not present" Error

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Experience Manager



### Issue/Symptoms

While trying to deploy a dispatcher pipeline as a Web Tier pipeline, the deployment failed with the error:
<br><br> <br><br>

```
ERROR: '44 CUSTOMER Opt-in file //opt-in/USE_SOURCES_DIRECTLY is not present. Build aborted.'
at runBuild(/usr/local/bin/build-zip.sh:203)
at status.track(/usr/local/bin/lib-status.bash:261)
at main(/usr/local/bin/build-zip.sh:214)
ERROR: Unexpected error type: 'CUSTOMER'
at status.internal.errorStatus(/usr/local/bin/lib-status.bash:25)
at status.error(/usr/local/bin/lib-status.bash:142)

at status.track(/usr/local/bin/lib-status.bash:261)
at main(/usr/local/bin/build-zip.sh:214)
ERROR: '1 TEST_FAILURE
```

<br><br> <br><br>
However, it worked when running it via Full Stack Pipeline.
 It happened when using a standard AEM project created using the latest archetype for the cloud; therefore, the dispatcher's configuration, being created based on the latest archetype, already followed the "Flexible mode," and the file `/opt-in/USE_SOURCES_DIRECTLY` was present.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The web tier pipeline had the CodeLocation set to "/" but the repo they had set on this pipeline was using `/dispatcher/src` instead.
After changing the code location `[` 1`]`  to `/dispatcher/src` the Web Tier pipeline was successfully deployed.
