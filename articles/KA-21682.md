# Adobe Audience Manager does not support opt-in after opt-out

## Description {#description}

<br>Environment<br><br>
- Adobe Audience Manager (AAM)

<br><br>Issue/Symptoms<br><br>
Audience Manager does not support opt-in after opt-out.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Once your end users opt-out of AAM they cannot opt back in.  There is no planned fix for this given how rare the opt-back-in use case is. To learn more about the Opt-in Service, see [Setting up Opt-in Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/id-service/using/implementation/opt-in-service/getting-started.html) in the Identify Service Guide.
