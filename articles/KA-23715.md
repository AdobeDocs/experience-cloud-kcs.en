# Maximum limit of variations, performance, and retention policy of content fragments


In this article, you will explore the questions relating to the maximum limit of variations, performance, and retention policy of content fragments.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service

### Issue/Symptoms

1. Is there a maximum limit to the number of *variations* allowed within a single <b>*content fragmen*t</b>?
2. Could multiple *variations*contribute to site slowness?
3. Is there any retention policy for deleted <b>*content fragments</b>*?



## Resolution {#resolution}


1. There are no documented limits for the number of variations for a single <b>*content fragment</b>*, but in general, it is recommended to have something in the range `[` 0-5`]`  for content maintenance purposes, but also limit possible performance issues (even though that depends on the underlying content model). It would be useful to know possible use cases that may go beyond that range.
2. Multiple variations may contribute to slowness, but that depends on the use case and, particularly, how the content fragment is consumed. This can vary depending on whether you are using headless or <b>*if content fragments</b>* are included in a page, etc.
3. There's no specific retention policy for deleted fragments. Please review the documentation relating to [general restore procedures](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-cloud-kcs/kbarticles/KA-23505.html?lang=en), and possibly this functionality as well, [Content Restore in AEM as a Cloud Service.](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/operations/restore.html?lang=en)
