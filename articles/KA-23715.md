# Maximum limit of variations, Performance and Retention policy of Content Fragments

## Description {#description}

Description<br>


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

1. Is there a maximum limit to the number of variations allowed within a single content fragment?
2. Could multiple variations contribute to site slowness?
3. Is there any retention policy for deleted Content Fragments?



## Resolution {#resolution}

Resolution<br><br>


1. There are no documented limits for the number of variations for a single Content fragment, but in general, it is recommended to have something in the range `[` 0-5`]`  for content maintenance purposes but also limit possible performance issues (even though that depends on the underlying content model) - It would be useful knowing possible use-cases that may go beyond that range
2. Multiple variations may contribute to slowness, but that depends on the use case and particularly, how the content fragment is consumed. This can vary depending if the customer is using headless, or Content fragments included in a page, etc.
3. There's no specific retention policy for deleted fragments. Please review the documentation relating to [general restore procedures](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-cloud-kcs/kbarticles/KA-23505.html?lang=en), and possibly this functionality as well, [Content Restore in AEM as a Cloud Service.](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/operations/restore.html?lang=en)
