You can tint the background of the container which contains the text. This would help in making the text more visible.
 You can apply style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);"Â  through Target and this should make the text more visible as it will tint the background container.

 NOTE: If you apply a background image to the same container then this would suppress the background color style.
