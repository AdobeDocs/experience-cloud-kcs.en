# Which requests does AEM Dispatcher cache?

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

AEM Dispatcher 4.3.3

<b>Issue</b>

This article determines why and which HTTP requests/responses are not being cached by the AEM Dispatcher.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The documentation covers the most important scenarios that affect the cache-ability of requests and responses which go through the AEM Dispatcher module. All cache rules are not covered.

<b>HTTP Request & Caching Rules</b>

For an HTTP request to be cacheable by the dispatcher, it must adhere to the following rules:

1. URL is absolute (not working with . or ..), has a file extension, and the filename in the URL works as a file on the file system.

    <u>Related log messages</u>:


    ```
    URI not canonical: %s.
    
    Unable to map URI to file: %s.
    
    cache file path too long
    
    temporary file path too long
    
    request URL has no extension
    ```



    <u>Examples</u>:


    | `/content/test` | `not cached` |
    | --- | --- |
    | `/content/test.html` | `cached` |


2. It has no slashes after the first file extension.

    <u>Related log messages</u>:


    ```
    request URL has trailing slash
    ```



    <u>Examples</u>:


    | `/content/test.html/` | `not cached` |
    | --- | --- |
    | `/content/test.html/foo.jpg` | `not cached` |
    | `/content/test.html` | `cached` |


3. It uses HTTP GET or HEAD method.

    <u>Related log messages</u>:


    ```
    request method is neither GET nor HEAD
    ```



    <u>Examples</u>:


    | `HEAD /content/test.html HTTP/1.1` | `cached` |
    | --- | --- |
    | `GET /content/dam/test.jpg HTTP/1.1` | `not cached` |
    | `POST /content/test.html HTTP/1.1` | `not cached` |


4. The request is denied by /CACHE =`>`  /RULES defined in the dispatcher. ANY FARM CONFIGURATION.

    <u>Related log messages</u>:


    ```
    URI not  in cache rules: %s request URL not in cache rules
    ```



    <u>Examples</u>:


    a. Not cached


    ```
    Farm has /cache =`>`  /rules and a request is received for /content/test.html
    /cache
    {
      ...
      /rules
      {
        /0001 {
          type "deny"
          glob "*"
          }
      }
    }
    ```



    b. Cached


    ```
    Farm has /cache =`>`  /rules and a request is received for /content/test.html
    /cache
    {
      ...
      /rules
      {
        /0001 {
          type "allow"
          glob "*"
          }
      }
    }
    ```


5. The HTTP request does not contain an authorization header or it contains the header but /ALLOWAUTHORIZED is set to 1 in the FARM CONFIGURATION.

    <u>Related log messages</u>:


    ```
    request contains authorization
    ```



    <u>Examples</u>:


    a. Not cached


    ```
    HTTP Request:
    
    GET /content/test.html HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic YWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuc2VzYW1l
    dispatcher.any farm /cache =`>`  /allowAuthorized configuration:
    /cache {
     /allowAuthorized “0”
    }
    ```



    b. Cached


    ```
    HTTP Request:
    
    GET /content/test.html HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic YWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuc2VzYW1l
    dispatcher.any farm /cache =`>`  /allowAuthorized configuration:
    /cache {
     /allowAuthorized “1”
    }
    ```


6. The HTTP request contains login-token or authorization cookie in the cookie header, or it contains either (or both) of those cookies and /ALLOWAUTHORIZED is set to 1 in the FARM CONFIGURATION.

    <u>Related log messages</u>:


    ```
    request contains authorization
    ```



    <u>Examples</u>:


    a. Not cached


    ```
    HTTP Request:
    
    GET /content/test.html HTTP/1.1
    Cookie: login-token=...
    dispatcher.any farm /cache = /allowAuthorized configuration:
    /cache {
     /allowAuthorized “0”
    }
    ```



    


    ```
    HTTP Request:
    
    GET /content/test.html HTTP/1.1
    Cookie: authorization= YWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuc2VzYW1l
    dispatcher.any farm /cache = /allowAuthorized configuration:
    /cache {
     /allowAuthorized “0”
    }
    ```



    b. Cached


    ```
    HTTP Request:
    
    GET /content/test.html HTTP/1.1
    Cookie: login-token=...
    dispatcher.any farm /cache =`>`  /allowAuthorized configuration:
    /cache {
     /allowAuthorized “1”
    }
    ```


7. There's a QUERYSTRING parameter in the URL and the parameter is allowed to be ignored via the FARM’S /IGNOREURLPARAMS CONFIGURATION.

    <u>Related log messages</u>:


    ```
    request contains a query string
    ```



    <u>Examples</u>:


    a. Cached


    ```
    HTTP Request:
    
    GET /content/test.html?test=1 HTTP/1.1
    Farm /cache configuration:
    
    /ignoreUrlParams { /0001 { /type “allow” /glob “*” }
    }
    ```



    


    ```
    HTTP Request:
    
    GET /content/test.html?test=1 HTTP/1.1
    Farm /cache configuration:
    /ignoreUrlParams { /0001 { /type “deny” /glob “*” } 
       /0001 { /type “allow” /glob “test” }
    }
    ```



    b. Not cached


    ```
    HTTP Request:
    
    GET /content/test.html?test=1 HTTP/1.1
    dispatcher.any farm /cache = /allowAuthorized configuration:
    /ignoreUrlParams {/0001 { /type “deny” /glob “*” } 
      /0001 { /type “allow” /glob “q” }
    }
    ```




<b>HTTP Response & Caching Rules:</b>

The HTTP response returned from AEM is cacheable if the following criteria are met:

1. The dispatcher is able to send and receive a 200 OK response from one of the defined “RENDERS”.

    <b>Note:</b> If no [/timeout](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-dispatcher/using/configuring/dispatcher-configuration.html?lang=en) is set on the /renders or it is set to 0 then it would wait forever for a connection to the AEM instance even if the instance is down.

    
    <u>Related log messages</u>:


    ```
    Unable to send request to remote server. Unable to receive response from remote server. Remote server returned: %s No backend available.
    ```



    <u>Examples</u>:


    | HTTP Request:<br><br>    200 OK | cached |
    | --- | --- |
    | HTTP Request:<br><br>    404 Page Not Found | not cached |


2. None of these response headers are present in the response:

    - `Dispatcher: no-cache`
    - `Cache-control: no-cache`
    - `Pragma: no-cache`



    <u>Related log messages</u>:


    ```
    Backend forbids caching: %s, sent: %s" response contains no_cache
    ```



    <u>Examples</u>:


    | HTTP Response:<br><br>    200 OK<br><br>    Dispatcher: no-cache | not cached |
    | --- | --- |
    | HTTP Response:<br><br>    200 OK<br><br>    Cache-control: no-cache | not cached |
    | HTTP Response:<br><br>    200 OK<br><br>    Pragma: no-cache | not cached |
    | HTTP Response:<br><br>    200 OK | cached |


3. Content-length value is greater than ZERO BYTES.
    <u>Related log messages</u>:


    ```
    response content length is zero
    ```



    <u>Examples</u>:


    | HTTP Response:<br><br>    200 OK<br><br>    Content-Length: 0 | not cached |
    | --- | --- |
    | HTTP Response:<br><br>    200 OK<br><br>    Content-Length: 3120 | cached |
