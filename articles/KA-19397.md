## Resolution {#resolution}


In Microsoft Windows, you can not create folders or have extensions with the below words.

CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, and LPT9.

These are reserved keywords in Windows. Which means, windows does not allow a user to use any of these words to name an instance and will show you an error while upgrading as a folder with an instance name is created in your system.



<b><u>Cause:</u></b>  'con' is a reserved keyword in Windows
