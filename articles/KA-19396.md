# Filter named byUuid has been defined in the Profile resource

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Campaign Standard




### <b>Issues/Symptoms</b>

A filter named 'byUuid' has been defined in the Profile resource.

The API request is failing in Postman with this error:
 Request: https://mc.adobe.io/\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*/campaign/profileAndServices/profile/byUuid?uuid_parameter=xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx

Response: RST-360011 An error has occurred. Please contact the administrator.
 BAS-010040 Cannot convert 'byUuid' (text type) to 32-bit integer type (bAS-010011 Invalid data).

If one makes a test directly in ACS, then the same error shows:
 https://\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*/rest/profileAndServices/profile/byUuid?uuid_parameter=xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxx&__securitytoken=...

And if one makes a test with '/rest/head/profile', then the response is good:
 https://\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*/rest/head/profile/byUuid?uuid_parameter=xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx&__securitytoken=...

The /rest/head/profile' is not the expected URL.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The `hasCustomFilter` parameter has to be set to true.

See below an example of code:




```
// initialize the sdk
```




`const campaignClient = await CampaignStandard.init(params.tenant, params.apiKey, token)`

`// Get all profiles from Campaign Standard and filter by uuid`

`let parameters = {`

`filters: [ 'byUuid'] ,`

`uuid_parameter:`

`uuid, hasCustomFilter: true`

`}`

`const profiles = await campaignClient.getAllProfiles(parameters)`
