# SSI/ESI Support in AEM as a Cloud Service


Explore the compatibility of SSI and ESI on AEM as a Cloud Service (AEMaaCS). Learn how SSI can be implemented using the default Apache module mod_include in AEM CS and local SDK.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Experience Manager



### <b>Issues/Symptoms</b>

Please confirm whether SSI or ESI is supported on AEMaaCS.

As  mod_include is not listed on `[` 1`]` , the tutorial in `[` 2`]`  may not be applicable for AEMaaCS.

2. [Set up Sling Dynamic Include](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/foundation/development/set-up-sling-dynamic-include.html) AEM Foundation Tutorials.





## Resolution {#resolution}


Currently, ESI is not supported with the OOTB CDN (Fastly) on AEM as a Cloud Service. This feature would require a way to disable `gzip` compression on the parent resources for ESI to work. Some of the challenges can be found in `[` 1`]`  for your information.

 Regarding SSI, the Apache module `'mod_include'` `[` 2`]`  is loaded by default and can be used for SSI using SDI (Sling Dynamic Includes), which works on both local SDK and AEM CS. Please see the community article at `[` 3`]`  for more information.
