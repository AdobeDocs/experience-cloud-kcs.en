# Override referrer variable with blank value

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Analytics

<b>Issue</b>
 Redirects point the web browser to a new location without user interaction. Consult [Redirects and aliases](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/technotes/redirects.html) in Adobe Analytics in Adobe Experience League for more information.

 When the redirection occurs, the browser clears the referring URL and assigns the originating URL as the referrer.

How can the referrer value be cleared to get the right attribution?


## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Solution</b>
To assign a blank value in the referrer variable, place the below piece of code within the <b>doPlugins</b> section:


```
s.referrer='';
s.Ia=1; //This is an 'eye' and not an 'ell'
```


For more information on doPlugins, see the [doPlugins](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/functions/doplugins.html "Click to follow link: https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/implementation/vars/functions/doplugins.html") article in Adobe Analytics Documentation in Adobe Experience League.
