# Personalize the subject of delivery using conditional content


This article explains how to get an alternative text if the `firstName` of the recipient is not captured in the subject line of the Dynamic code in Adobe Campaign Classic.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Campaign
- Campaign Classic


### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

How to get an alternative text if the `firstName` of the recipient is not captured in the subject line of the Dynamic code?

For example:

Subject: `<%= recipient.firstName %>`, please check our offer.

In case the `firstName` is filled, it will return: *recipient.firstName, please check our offer*.

In case the `firstName` is empty (Not filled), it will return: *Hey, please check our offer.*




## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>You can use the below conditional content in the subject of the delivery:</b>

`<% if ( recipient.firstName != '' ) { %> <%= recipient.firstName %>, please check our offer. <% } else { %> Hey, please check our offer. <% } %>`

- When the `firstName` is filled, it will return:

    *recipient.firstName, please check our offer.*


<b>else</b>

- When the `firstName` is empty (Not filled), it will return:

    *Hey, please check our offer.*
