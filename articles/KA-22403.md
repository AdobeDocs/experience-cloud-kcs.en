# Personalize the subject of delivery using conditional content

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Campaign
- Campaign Classic




### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

How to get an alternative text if the `firstName` of the recipient is not captured in the subject line of the Dynamic code?

For example:

Subject: ``<` %= recipient.firstName %`>``, please check our offer.

In case the `firstName` is filled, it will return: *recipient.firstName, please check our offer*.

In case the `firstName` is empty (Not filled), it will return: *Hey, please check our offer.*




## Resolution {#resolution}

<b>You can use the below conditional content in the subject of the delivery:</b>
``<` % if ( recipient.firstName != '' ) { %`>`  `<` %= recipient.firstName %`>` , please check our offer. `<` % } else { %`>`  Hey, please check our offer. `<` % } %`>``

- When the `firstName` is filled, it will return:

    *recipient.firstName, please check our offer.*


<b>else</b>

- When the `firstName` is empty (Not filled), it will return:

    *Hey, please check our offer.*
