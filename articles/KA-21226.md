# Adobe Campaign: V8 Low delivery preperation

## Description {#description}


It has been reported in V8 8.3.8 versions of Adobe Campaign Classic that the preparation of delivery will suddenly finish but only prepare a small portion of the delivery. This prevents the remaining population from being processed and sent. The cause of this is a bug in Campaign where the process will fail if processing a delivery part with large amounts of mData.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The fix for this issue has been included in releases starting from 8.3.9 under the reference NEO-48654.
