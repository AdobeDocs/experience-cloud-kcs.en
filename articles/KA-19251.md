# AEP - How to run an on-demand evaluation for a specific segment

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

- Adobe Experience Platform

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Say you have an Edge segment, and you would like to do random evaluation checks to see how the segment is evolving during a specific timeframe, without having to wait for the daily batch evaluation.

*NB: Edge segmentation is the ability to evaluate segments in Adobe Experience Platform instantaneously on the edge*



This is related to the following documentation: [https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/segmentation/tutorials/evaluate-a-segment.html#on-demand-evaluation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/segmentation/tutorials/evaluate-a-segment.html#on-demand-evaluation)

*NB: On-demand evaluation allows you to create a segment job in order to generate an audience segment whenever you require it. Unlike scheduled evaluation, this will happen only when requested and is not recurring.*


## Resolution {#resolution}


This can be achieved via what we call an <b>on-demand evaluation</b> where you can create a new segment job by making a POST request to the /segment/jobs endpoint in the Real-time Customer Profile API.



Here is a way to do this:



- First, you'll need to create a segment job specifically for this segment, using:


POST https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/ups/segment/jobs with the following body:

*{
        "segmentId": "segmentID_value"
    }*



This created Segment Job ID "id": "*segmentJobID_value*"



- Then you'll need to check the status of the segment job using the following:


GET https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/ups/segment/jobs/*segmentJobID_value*



This is going through different processing stages until it succeeds

*"status": "QUEUED",
 "status": "PROCESSING",
 "status": "SUCCEEDED",*



- <b>Results</b>


*"segmentedProfileCounter": {
            "segmentID_value": 21
        },*

*},
        "segmentedProfileByStatusCounter": {
            "segmentID_value": {
                "existing": 18,
                "realized": 3,*



*NB: This segment was showing a population of 19 profiles. It went up to 21 following our on-demand segment job and this was outside of the daily batch evaluation.*
