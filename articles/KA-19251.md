# How to run an on-demand evaluation for a specific segment?

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Platform

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Say you have an Edge segment, and you would like to do random evaluation checks to see how the segment is evolving during a specific timeframe, without having to wait for the daily batch evaluation.

NOTE - Edge segmentation is the ability to evaluate segments in Adobe Experience Platform instantaneously on the edge

This is related to the following documentation: [https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/segmentation/tutorials/evaluate-a-segment.html#on-demand-evaluation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/segmentation/tutorials/evaluate-a-segment.html#on-demand-evaluation)

*NB: On-demand evaluation allows you to create a segment job in order to generate an audience segment whenever you require it. Unlike scheduled evaluation, this will happen only when requested and is not recurring.*


## Resolution {#resolution}


This can be achieved via an <b>on-demand evaluation</b> where you can create a new segment job by making a POST request to the /segment/jobs endpoint in the Real-time Customer Profile API. Here is a way to do this:

- First, create a segment job specifically for this segment, using:


`POST https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/ups/segment/jobs` with the following body:


```
{
   "segmentId": "segmentID_value"
}
```


This created Segment Job ID `"id": "segmentJobID_value"`

- Then check the status of the segment job using the following:


`GET https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/ups/segment/jobs/segmentJobID_value`

This goes through different processing stages until it succeeds




```
"status": "QUEUED",
"status": "PROCESSING",
"status": "SUCCEEDED",
```




- This results in the following:





```
"segmentedProfileCounter": {
            "segmentID_value": 21
            }

            "segmentedProfileByStatusCounter": {
            "segmentID_value": }
                    "existing": 18,
                    "realized": 3,
```




*NB: This segment was showing a population of 19 profiles. It went up to 21 following our on-demand segment job and this was outside of the daily batch evaluation.*
