# AEM GraphQL configuration issues

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Experience Manager

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

When developing a website that should retrieve data from its AEM (Adobe Experience Manager) instances using AEM headless solution, the tutorial in (1) was followed to set up the endpoint.

 After publishing all the content fragments, models, content, references, assets, and queries as described in (2), when retrieving any content fragment from the publish instance, a <b>404 error</b> is received, preventing the content from being read by the publisher.

## Resolution {#resolution}


After checking the dispatcher logs, it was noticed that the request to the customer's GraphQL endpoint - `/content/cq:graphql/graphql/endpoint.json` was blocked at the dispatcher level - (1).

The dispatcher needs to be configured to specifically allow persisted queries to the endpoint.
Please follow (2) for more details about how to configure the dispatcher.
