# Change the Server and JVM timezone to Europe/Paris in AEM as a Cloud Service


In Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service (AEMaaCS), both server and JVM time zones are set to UTC. To accommodate different time zones, it is crucial to incorporate time zone conversion within your application's logic. This ensures that all time-sensitive operations correspond with your preferred time zone, like Europe/Paris.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service (AEMaaCS)

### Issue

How to change the Server and JVM (Java Virtual Machine) timezones to Europe/Paris?


## Resolution {#resolution}


Unfortunately, in AEM as a Cloud Service, you can't change the Timezone of the server or the JVM, and all logs are served in UTC timezone.

The best approach would be to handle timezone conversion within your application logic. You should account that the server timezone will be UTC and perform any necessary conversions programmatically to the desired timezone (Europe/Paris).

If you need guidance on implementing these changes within your application, refer to the Java documentation for handling timezones.
