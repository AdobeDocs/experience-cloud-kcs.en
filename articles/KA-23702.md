# Change the Server and JVM timezone to Europe/Paris in AEM as a Cloud Service

## Description {#description}

Description<br>

### <b>Environment</b>


Experience Manager as a Cloud Service

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

The customer requested to change the Server and JVM timezone to Europe/Paris


## Resolution {#resolution}

Resolution<br>
Unfortunately, in AEM as a Cloud Service, you cannot change the Timezone of the server or the JVM, and all logs are served in UTC timezone.

The best approach would be to handle timezone conversion within your application logic. You should account that the server timezone will be UTC and perform any necessary conversions programmatically to the desired timezone (Europe/Paris).

If you need guidance on implementing these changes within your application, refer to the Java documentation for handling timezones.
