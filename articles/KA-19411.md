## Resolution


This issue occurs because the option under campaign template properties “[!UICONTROL Functionalities used in the campaign]” is not enabled.



- Check the campaign template associated with the campaign.
- Open the campaign template.
- Go to [!UICONTROL Edit] - [!UICONTROL Advanced campaign parameters...] - [!UICONTROL Configurations].




On this screen, you will see "[!UICONTROL Targeting and workflows]" and select the value as Yes.
