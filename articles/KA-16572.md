# DRM Error 3324 [MachineTokenInvalid] Sub Error Code = 111

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
Primetime


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
When trying to play AAXS (Adobe Access) protected DRM stream, getting the following error:

*DrmErrorCode 3324:111*


## Resolution


1. Check if you have updated all of your *Access DRM License Servers*to trust the new *Individualization Service endpoint*that we recently stood up. Follow the instructions outlined in this post: [https://community.adobe.com/](https://community.adobe.com/).
2. If you have done the above, then perhaps the *DRM license server*(1 or more of them) was not updated properly and/or not restarted after the update described above.
3. If the above two did not work, then perhaps there is a *firewall/access issue*for the *Access DRM license server,*which is preventing it from hitting the following URL (which is where the license server must get the CRL (Certificate Revocation List) file from).  Please check to make sure your server can reach the CRL endpoint. There was a new CRL endpoint that was stood up to serve the new individualization server. Perhaps your license server has access issues hitting this new endpoint: [http://individualization-crl.primetime.adobe.com/FlashAccessIndividualizationCA.crl](http://individualization-crl.primetime.adobe.com/FlashAccessIndividualizationCA.crl).


If you are indeed having access issues reaching this file, to get around the current hurdle, you can manually copy that file to your license server and (if you're using *Tomcat*), place it into the `tomcat/temp/` folder, which is where downloaded `.crl` files go.


<b>Cause</b>
A 3324 error is dispatched if the license server does not recognize the client's *MachineToken*.  This token is provisioned by the Individualization service, and if the Individualization service uses a certificate that is not trusted by the Access DRM license server, the token is obviously *invalid*.

Sub-Error-ID 111 is the server-side error code and maps to `REQ_MACHINE_TOKEN_INVALID_EXPIRED`, which happens if the client's Machine Token is expired or invalid.
