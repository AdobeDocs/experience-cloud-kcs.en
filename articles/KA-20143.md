# How to find out about Adobe Target call volume

## Description

I would like to know how many calls Adobe Target is currently using, is there any way I can see this, like the "Server Call Usage" feature in Adobe Analytics?

## Resolution


Adobe Target calculates its fees based on the number of page views on your site. Therefore, you can check the number of page views for all pages where at.js is implemented by using Adobe Analytics. But, We also recommend that you contact your Customer Success Manager for more information, as it may be related to the license agreement.
