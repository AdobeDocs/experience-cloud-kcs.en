# Adobe Campaign Standard: Hotclick report not displaying data ACS

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign Standard

<br> <br><b>Issues/Symptoms</b><br> <br>It has been reported that the Hotclicks report does not display the data for new deliveries while it is working for older deliveries. Additionally, within the delivery's tracking logs, there is no tracking populating.<br> <br>

<br> <br>

<br> 

## Resolution


The cause of the issue is that the technical workflow (`updateDeliveryIndicators`) is not running. This workflow generates the indicator statistics required for reporting the *Hotclicks*report.

Restart the workflow and ensure that it continues to run. Once it has run for an hour or two, the *Hotclicks*report should populate.



To find the technical workflow follow the path below:
