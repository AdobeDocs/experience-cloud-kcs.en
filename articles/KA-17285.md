# Adobe Campaign Standard: [!UICONTROL Hot clicks] report not displaying data ACS

## Description

It has been reported that the [!UICONTROL Hot clicks] report does not display the data for new deliveries while it is working for older deliveries. Additionally, within the delivery's tracking logs, there is no tracking populating.<br><br> <br><br>

 <br>

<br><br> 

## Resolution


The cause of the issue is that the technical workflow (updateDeliveryIndicators) is not running. This workflow generates the indicator statistics required for reporting the [!UICONTROL Hot clicks] report.

Restart the workflow and ensure that it continues to run. Once it has run for an hour or two, the [!UICONTROL Hot clicks] report should populate.



To find the technical workflow follow the path below:

Adobe Campaign > [!UICONTROL Administration] > [!UICONTROL Application Settings] > [!UICONTROL Workflows]
