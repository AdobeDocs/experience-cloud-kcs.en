# Campaign Classic - Missing Zero ID Record

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign Classic
- Campaign



<b>Issues/Symptoms</b>
Prior to a build upgrade, when running an upgrade Pre-Check in a Campaign instance, we are seeing a warning:


```
-------  0 id record is missing from the following schemas

+++++++++++  Contact Consultant : Fix and regenerate specified schemas.

_____ | schema                   

      | nms:recipient            

      | cus:xxxxx     

      | cus:xxxxx         

      | cus:xxxxx        

      | cus:xxxxx
```

<br>Questions:<br><br>


1. Public understanding is that the zero ID record auto-generated and required when schemas are linked. How would someone intentionally or inadvertently delete this record?
2. Once the zero ID record has been deleted, what is the recommended approach to restoring it? A direct SQL command?



## Resolution {#resolution}


1. Public understanding is that the zero ID record auto-generated and required when schemas are linked. How would someone intentionally or inadvertently delete this record? Someone fired a SQL directly to delete all records from the table (instead of using the Update data activity)
2. Once the zero ID record has been deleted, what is the recommended approach to restoring it? A direct SQL command? Find out all integer columns in the schema and create an INSERT query with 0 populated for all those columns. This should recreate the 0 record. You will have to create a SQL script in the script section of Explorer in Campaign or use a SQL code activity in a workflow to be able to do this.
