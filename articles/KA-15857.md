# AEM adds '.html' to the Redirect URL of Internal Pages

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Experience Manager

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
`AEM adds .html to the URL fragment (or anchor, the last part of the URL starting from #). For example:`


```
/content/we-retail/us/en/men.html#FEATURED - /content/we-retail/us/en/men.html#FEATURED.html

Steps to reproduce:
```



```
1-Create a new content page page1 under /content/we-retail.
```



```
2-Select page1  Properties.
```



```
3-In Advanced tab  'Redirect' field, set '/content/we-retail/us/en/men.html#FEATURED'.
```



```
4-Access page1 with 'View as Published'.
```



```
$  curl -v -u admin:admin http://localhost:6402/content/we-retail/page1.html?wcmmode=disabled
```



```
* About to connect() to localhost port 6402 (#0)
```



```
...
```



```
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
```



```

```



```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```



```
Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
```



```
Location: http://localhost:6402/content/we-retail/us/en/men.html#FEATURED.html?wcmmode=disabled
```



```
Content-Length: 0
```



```
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
```



## Resolution


This is a hard-coded behavior. The `com.day.cq.wcm.foundation.impl.PageRedirectServlet#doGet` is adding *.html* to the redirect URL if the redirect target is a space within the same AEM.
