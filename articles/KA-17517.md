# Migration from the legacy binary protocol to HTTP/2-based APNs

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Campaign Classic

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

The Apple Push Notification service (APNs) will no longer support the legacy binary protocol as of March 31, 2021. [Read more](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=c88acm2b).

Adobe Campaign Classic supports two Apple Push Notification service (APNs) protocols:

- <b>legacy binary</b> protocol, which is the default protocol for all Campaign Classic versions.
- <b>HTTP/2</b> protocol, which is already available and is the new default protocol in the releases below:


If push notifications are being sent with the legacy Apple binary protocol, they need to be upgraded to one of the releases below or use an HTTP/2-based APNs provider API.

Steps to update to <b>HTTP/2</b> protocol are detailed below.


## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Check your version</b>

Check [Campaign Classic build number](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/getting-started/starting-with-adobe-campaign/launching-adobe-campaign.html?lang=en#getting-your-campaign-version) on all instances.

- If the build number is older than 8766, Campaign does not support HTTP/2 protocol and needs to be upgraded to a newer version. [Learn how to upgrade](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/monitoring-campaign-classic/updating-adobe-campaign/build-upgrade.html?lang=en#performing-a-build-upgrade).
- If the build number is 8766 or later, Campaign supports HTTP/2 protocol and can be updated to use HTTP/2 protocol.
- If a hosted or hybrid customer, please reach out to [Adobe Customer Care team](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/customer-one/using/home.html?lang=en) to plan this upgrade.
- If an on-premises customer, please update the configuration as described below.


<b>Update configuration</b>

To migrate to HTTP/2 protocol, update the [External account](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/installing-campaign-classic/accessing-external-database/external-accounts.html?lang=en) used for iOS deliveries of all instances as described below:

1. Log into the instance as Administrator.
2. Open the External account [used to perform iOS deliveries](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/sending-push-notifications/configure-the-mobile-app/configuring-the-mobile-application.html?lang=en). To identify this external account, make sure the Channel parameter is set to iOS channel and the Enabled option is checked, as below:    ![iOS External Account](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/campaign/kb/migrate-to-http2/jcr_content/main-pars/procedure/proc_par/step_1/step_par/image/iOS-ext-account.png "iOS-ext-account")
