# Adobe Campaign Classic: How to migrate from the legacy binary protocol to HTTP/2-based APNs provider API

## Description


The [!DNL Apple] Push Notification service (APNs) will no longer support the legacy binary protocol as of March 31, 2021. [Read more](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=c88acm2b).

Adobe Campaign Classic supports two [!DNL Apple] Push Notification service (APNs) protocols:

- <b>legacy binary</b> protocol, which is the default protocol for all Campaign Classic versions.
- <b>HTTP/2</b> protocol, which is already available and is the new default protocol in the following releases: 
   - Campaign Classic 21.1 release. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/release-notes/gs-release/gold-standard.html)
   - [!DNL Campaign] 20.2.4 release. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/release-notes/previous-releases/release--20-2.html?lang=en#release-notes)
   - [!DNL Campaign] 19.1.8 release. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/release-notes/previous-releases/release--19-1.html?lang=en#release-19-1-8-build-9039)

<br><br><br><br> <br><br>
If push notifications are being sent with the legacy [!DNL Apple] binary protocol, they need to be upgraded to one of the releases below or use an HTTP/2-based APNs provider API.

Steps to update to <b>HTTP/2</b> protocol are detailed below.


## Resolution

<br><br>Check your version<br><br><br><br> <br><br>
1) Check [Campaign Classic build number](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/campaign-classic/using/getting-started/starting-with-adobe-campaign/launching-adobe-campaign.html#getting-your-campaign-version) on all instances

- If the build number is older than <b>8766</b>, Campaign does not support <b>HTTP/2</b>  protocol and needs to be upgraded to a newer version. [Learn how to upgrade](https://helpx.adobe.com/campaign/kb/acc-build-upgrade.html).
- If the build number is <b>8766</b> or later, [!DNL Campaign] supports HTTP/2 protocol and can be updated to use <b>HTTP/2</b> protocol.
- If a hosted or hybrid customer, please [reach out to Adobe Customer Care team](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/customer-one/using/home.html) to plan this upgrade.
- If an on-premise customer, please update the configuration as described below.

<br><br><br><br> <br><br>Update configuration<br><br><br><br> <br><br>
To migrate to HTTP/2 protocol, update the [External account](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/campaign-classic/using/getting-started/administration-basics/external-accounts.html) used for iOS deliveries of all instances as described below:

- &#x200B;
   1) Log into the instance as <b>Administrator</b>.


- &#x200B;
   &#x200B;2) Open the <b>External account</b> [used to perform iOS deliveries](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/sending-push-notifications/configure-the-mobile-app/configuring-the-mobile-application.html). To identify this external account, make sure the <b>[!UICONTROL Channel]</b> parameter is set to <b>iOS channel</b> and the <b>[!UICONTROL Enabled]</b> option is checked, as below:
      ![iOS External Account](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/campaign/kb/migrate-to-http2/jcr_content/main-pars/procedure/proc_par/step_1/step_par/image/iOS-ext-account.png "iOS-ext-account")


- &#x200B;
   &#x200B;3) Click on the <b>[!UICONTROL Connector]</b> tab, and set the value of <b>[!UICONTROL Access URL of the connector]</b> to:
      <br> <br>
   | `http://localhost:8080/nms/jsp/iosHTTP2.jsp` |
