# Google Play Rejects App Due To WebView SSL Error Handler Issue | Adobe Authentication Native Android SDK

## Description

Google Play rejects App due to WebView SSL Error Handler issue when programmer is submitting an android app that has Adobe Authentication Native Android SDK implemented into it.

## Resolution


This is due to unsafe implementation of the[WebViewClient.onReceivedSslError](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebViewClient.html#onReceivedSslError%28android.webkit.WebView,%20android.webkit.SslErrorHandler,%20android.net.http.SslError%29) handler in Android apps. <b>Beginning</b> <b>November 25, 2016</b>, <b>Google Play started blocking publishing of any new apps or updates that contain this vulnerability</b>. Read more [here](https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7071387?hl=en).

Programmer needs to remove implementation of this method from their code:

<b>*onReceivedSslError</b>(WebView view, SslErrorHandler handler, SslError error);*

If programmer is referencing to DemoApp and have DemoApp sources in their application, they need to delete the <b>onReceivedSslError </b>from:

*MainActivity.java, MvpdLogoutActivity.java,*and *MvpdLoginActivity.java.*

Adobe Authentication Native Android SDK library is compliant with this since SDK version 1.9.1.
