# Google Play rejects app due to WebView SSL Error Handler Issue


Fix the google play rejects app error due to WebView SSL Handler Issue by removing the implementation of this method from the code.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Primetime



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Google Play rejects app due to WebView SSL Error Handler issue when the programmer is submitting an Android app that has Adobe Authentication Native Android SDK implemented into it.


## Resolution {#resolution}


This is due to the unsafe implementation of the[WebViewClient.onReceivedSslError](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebViewClient.html#onReceivedSslError%28android.webkit.WebView,%20android.webkit.SslErrorHandler,%20android.net.http.SslError%29) handler in Android apps. Beginning November 25, 2016, Google Play started blocking publishing of any new apps or updates that contain this vulnerability. Read more [here](https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7071387?hl=en).

The programmer needs to remove implementation of this method from their code:

<b>*`onReceivedSslError`</b>`(WebView view, SslErrorHandler handler, SslError error);`*

If the programmer is referencing to DemoApp and have DemoApp sources in their application, they need to delete the <b>`onReceivedSslError `</b>from:

*`MainActivity.java, MvpdLogoutActivity.java,` and `MvpdLoginActivity.java.`*

Adobe Authentication Native Android SDK library is compliant with this since the SDK version 1.9.1.
