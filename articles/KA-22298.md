# User Profiles for Brand Portal not working as expected

## Description {#description}


<b>Description</b> : User has been assigned to Product Profile for BrandePortal, folder worth of assets has been shared with that user group in BP, 8 hours waited for the Product profile to replicate. User logged into BP but cannot see any content.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Resolution: Folder share in BrandPortal was done before the profile was replicated from adminconsole to BP, so the share was not saved correctly. Re-saving the asset share takes care of this issue.
