# User Profiles for Brand Portal not working as expected

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Experience Manager Assets

### Issue/Symptoms

You are assigned to a product profile for BrandPortal, where a folder worth of assets is shared with your user group. After waiting 8 hours for the product profile to replicate, you log in to Brand Portal, but do not see any content.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The folder share in BrandPortal was done before the profile was replicated from adminconsole to BrandPortal, so the share was not saved correctly. Re-saving the asset share takes care of this issue.
