# Table has no preset width when inserted using the Rich Text Editor component - AEM 6.x


If you don't want to use a fixed width, you can use a percentage instead.Â Use the Table Foundation component instead of inserting the table through the Rich Text Editor.

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
Adobe Experience Manager 6.x (AEM 6.x)

<b>Issue</b>
When using a Rich Text Editor component and insert a table and don't set the Width on the Table Properties pop-up, it will be displayed as if there was no width.

This makes it difficult to select the cells individually.


## Resolution {#resolution}


<b><u>Solution 1</u>:</b>

If you don't want to use a fixed width, you can use a percentage instead. For example, you can set it to *100%*.

<b><u>Solution 2</u>:</b>

Use the Table Foundation component instead of inserting the table through the Rich Text Editor. This is not recommended, as it is a deprecated component.
