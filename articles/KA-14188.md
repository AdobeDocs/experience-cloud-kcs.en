# Table has no preset width when inserted using the Rich Text Editor component | AEM 6.x

## Description


When you use a Rich Text Editor component and insert a table and don't set the Width on the Table Properties pop-up, it will be displayed as if there was no width. This makes it difficult to select the cells individually.


## Resolution


<b>Solution 1:</b>

 If you don't want to use a fixed width, you can use a percentage instead. For example, you can set it to 100%.

<b>Solution 2:</b>

Use the Table Foundation component instead of inserting the table through the Rich Text Editor. This is not recommended as it is a deprecated component.
