# Error: "The message can't be validated: ...." despite non-required field


For a field marked as "*Required*" in the Experience Data Model (XDM) schema, this means the field has to be present in the incoming data for validation purposes.

If marked as "*Not required*", but it is present then it must adhere to its definition, (with "*string*"<b> </b>value as opposed to no value at all).

The value `null` is not accepted/supported by Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) ingestion process. If a field does not have a value, then it must be excluded from the payload.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Platform (AEP)



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

During data ingestion, an error message occurs: "The message can't be validated: `[` #/_field_path: expected type: String, found: Null`]` " despite the field not being required.

What is the definition of "*Required*" in this case?
