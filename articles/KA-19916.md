# Error: "The message can't be validated: ...." despite non-required field

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b><br><br>Experience Platform<br><br> <br><br> <br><br><b>Issue/Symptoms</b><br><br>During data ingestion, an error message pops - "The message can't be validated: #/_field_path: expected type: String, found: Null" despite the field not being required.<br><br> <br><br>What is the definition of <b>'Required'</b> in this case?<br>

## Resolution {#resolution}


For a field marked as '<b>Required'</b> in the Experience Data Model (XDM) schema, this means the field has to be present in the incoming data for validation purposes.

If marked as <b>‘Not required’, </b>but it is present then it must adhere to its definition, i.e., with<b> 'string' </b>value as opposed to no value at all.



The value `null` is not accepted/supported by Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) ingestion process. If a field does not have a value, then it must be excluded from the payload.
