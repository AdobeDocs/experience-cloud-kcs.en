# Understanding the Discrepancy Between Delivered and Opened Emails in the Delivery Summary Report

## Description {#description}


In some scenarios, the customer delivery summary report may show that fewer emails have been delivered than opened. This can be confusing and cause concern for users. However, this issue can be easily explained.


## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Explanation:</b>

In some scenarios, the customer delivery summary report may show that fewer emails have been delivered than opened. This can be confusing and cause concern for users. However, this issue can be easily explained.

Suppose a mail was sent, and the recipient opened the email, clicked on a link, and then marked it as SPAM. In such a scenario, the feedback loop will make the delivery count zero. This means that the number of delivered emails will be counted as zero (broad logs), whereas the number of unique clicks will be more than zero (tracking logs). As a result, the report will show fewer emails delivered than opened.

<b>Remedies:</b>

You can check the number of emails marked as bounced in the delivery summary report to understand the extent of the issue.

You can also ask the customer to consult with Field Services/Adobe PS consulting via their CSM if they need more custom reporting based on their requirements.

*Note: Please note that we incorrectly flip the status of a message to "Failed" when an inbound email is processed for it (in this case a spam complaint). That message was in fact delivered, so we should leave the status as 'Sent' and count it as a delivered email, but we don't. I just wanted to draw your attention to the fact that in this scenario Adobe Campaign is incorrectly resetting the status to 'Failed'. That was supposed to be fixed in ACS, but I don't believe it has been done yet.*
