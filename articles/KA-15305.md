# Character sets in Campaign SMTP character encoding option not visible

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Campaign Classic
 Adobe Campaign

<b>Issue</b>
 Character sets in Adobe Campaign SMTP character encoding option in Delivery Properties were not visible.

<b>Cause</b>
 The cause is the database is not an Unicode database.


## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Solution</b>

1. The `XtkDatabaseId` value in option field defines the ID of the database. It begins with a "u" for Unicode database. Please refer to the [List of Campaign Classic options](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/installing-campaign-classic/appendices/configuring-campaign-options.html) in our Campaign Classic documentation in Adobe Experience League for more information.

2. This means if the database ID is Unicode, you would be able to view the following:

3. When you change the `XtkDatabaseId` value in option field, that part is not visible as `IsUnicode()` part of condition in not meeting in code as below:



```
container type="visibleGroup" visibleIf="EV(@messageType, 'mail') and IsUnicode()"
                     xpath="advancedParameters"
            container label="Character encoding" type="frame"
              input useDesc="true" xpath="@forceCodepage"/
              container type="visibleGroup" visibleIf="@forceCodepage"
                input xpath="@codepage"/
              /container
            /container
          /container
```




In this example, the database collaboration was "Latin1_General_CI_AS". Hence their `XtkDatabaseId` value in option field was not starting from u, and that is the reason that part is not visible.
