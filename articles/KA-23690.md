# Request for Deletion workflow triggered on content deletion


When a user logs in and deletes a page or asset in AEM, the "Request for Deletion" workflow is triggered. If you would like the user to be able to delete the content under a certain path, then allow them [replication privilege](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-release-information/aem-release-updates/previous-updates/aem-previous-versions.html) on the path.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Experience Manager 6.0 (AEM 6.0) and later versions

### Issue/Symptoms

When a user logs in and deletes a page or asset in AEM, the "Request for Deletion" workflow is triggered.

### Cause

This is by design.


## Resolution {#resolution}


If the user doesn't have replication privileges under a path, and you try to delete content under that path, it triggers the <b>Request for Deletion</b> workflow.

If you would like the user to be able to delete the content under a certain path, then allow them [replication privilege](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-release-information/aem-release-updates/previous-updates/aem-previous-versions.html) on the path.
