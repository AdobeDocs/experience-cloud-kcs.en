<br><br>Full error:<br><br>
RST-360011 An error has occurred. Please get in touch with the administrator.

## Resolution

How to fix:<br><br>
The workflow needs to be recreated entirely, either from scratch or by copy-pasting the full content of the workflow in a new one.

<b>Note - </b>Duplicating doesn't fix the issue.
