The workflow is corrupted.

RST-360011 An error has occurred. Please get in touch with the administrator.

SCM-120008 Can not find key values ​​for <b>element_name</b> element ('original' schema document, '<b>wkf_id'</b> name, and '<b>wkf_label'</b> description)


## Resolution {#resolution}


The workflow needs to be recreated entirely, either from scratch or by copy-pasting the full content of the workflow in a new one.

<b>Note - </b>Duplicating doesn't fix the issue.
