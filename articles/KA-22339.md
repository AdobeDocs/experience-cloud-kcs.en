# Custom link is not named Link Click

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Adobe Analytics
- Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection
- AEP Web SDK


### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

The custom link is not named *Link Click.*


## Resolution {#resolution}


For AEP Web SDK version `<` 2.15, Adobe used to set the link name to *Link Click* whenever the name of the custom link was not specified.

Since AEP Web SDK version 2.15, Adobe stopped setting `web.webInteraction.name` to the static *Link Click*. It now tries to find the exact/real name of the link by looking in different places, like the inner text of the anchor link. So, if the AEP Web SDK version is upgraded to 2.15 or greater, *Link Click* won't appear in the report.
