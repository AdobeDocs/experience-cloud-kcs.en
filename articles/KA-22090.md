# Error: "Mandatory property jcr:data cannot be removed" while publishing assets


The replication agent's transport URI - (Uniform Resource Identifier) has an extra *&amp* (Sending a POST request to `https://publish2useast1.stage.loyaltyone.adobecqms.net/bin/receive?sling:authRequestLogin=1&amp;binaryless=true`).

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)

### <b>Issue</b>

Replication queues are suddenly getting blocked when assets are published.

While messages <b>`[` 1`]` </b> were present in the publisher instance logs, the author logs had the statement,Â `Mandatory property jcr:data can not be removed`, as part of replication exceptions <b>`[` 2`]` :</b>


<b>`[` 1`]` </b> \*INFO\* `[` xxxxx`]`  POST /bin/receive HTTP/1.1`]`  com.day.cq.replication.impl.content.durbo.DurboImportTransformer Unable to set (protected) property '/content/dam/asset_folder/asset.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/original/jcr:content/binary_reference_jcr__data' : javax.jcr.nodetype.ConstraintViolationException: No matching property definition: binary_reference_jcr__data = a1cbdabd2d4114766b63098a6e0f709cf9dad9861a2660f4bee7eb0f04560730:69185c7dd58c0fcc0724072b4e418146cd54d285:71150<br><br>

## Resolution {#resolution}


The replication agent's transport URI - (Uniform Resource Identifier) has an extra *&amp* (Sending a POST request to `https://publish2useast1.stage.loyaltyone.adobecqms.net/bin/receive?sling:authRequestLogin=1&amp;binaryless=true`).

The Transport URI was modified as part of the <b>Certification</b> renewal process for the Amazon Managed Services (AMS)-hosted Author and Publisher instances, which is when the URI encoding took place.

This encoding was producing errors for the author and publisher by mucking with the <b>binary less replication</b>.
