# Links have gray background appear when email sent to .sfr inboxes

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Campaign Standard

<b>Issue</b>
 When building an email using the new [!UICONTROL Email designer], and sending it to an SFR inbox, the links in the email appear with a gray background under them.


## Resolution


<b>Cause</b>
The SFR webmail seems to be adding some css styles to the email which cause the issue.

<b>Solution</b>
To fix this, try adding the following css style in the code of the email:


```
style type="text/css" th a, th a:link, th a:visited {
    background: none !important;}/style
```
