# ACS - Links have a grey background appear when an email is sent to .sfr inboxes

## Description


When building an email using the new Email Designer, and sending it to an SFR inbox, the links in the email appear with a grey background under them.


## Resolution


The SFR webmail seems to be adding some css styles to the email which cause the issue.

To fix this, tryÂ adding the following css style in the code of the email:



style type="text/css" th a, th a:link, th a:visited {

background: none !important;}/style
