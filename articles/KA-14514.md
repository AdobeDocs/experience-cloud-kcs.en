# Activity based on Time Frame targeting not working

## Description


We have an activity that runs  only on Wednesday and Sunday.

We have included the time frame as :

Week and Day Parting

Wednesday - All Day

Sunday - All Day

Due to this refinement, the activity runs only on Wednesday and Sunday.I expect this activity to run at sharp 00:00 of every Wednesday and Sunday but we have noticed the lag of around 15-20 minutes ? I see the experience after 15-20 min àat 00:20.


## Resolution


the time which needs to be input in the 'Time Frame' audience is GMT +5 time.

If you need the activity to be delivered from Friday 00:00 to Friday 23:59, then you can configure the time as Thursday 23:30 to Friday: 23:30.
