# Test_EXL_ISV_PUB

## Description

 
Issue : Push deliveries in ACS starts to fail with error <b>ERR_FAILUREMCPNSAPI 412    Precondition Failed </b>
 
![](assets/___276b812e-9a35-ed11-9db1-000d3a5c1bcc___.png)
 

 

## Resolution


The iOS certificate is expired which throws this error in the delivery logs.

The certificate for iOS channel impacts also the android deliveries because of the way the certificate is saved in MCPNS and ACS.

One App id is created in ACS which holds information about iOS and Android.

The same app ID is propagated to MCPNS and a single App ID is present for both channels.

Hence the expiration of the certificate in iOS leads to the failure of both channels
