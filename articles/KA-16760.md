How to verify that binary-less replication is working?


## Resolution


Copying blog in case author deletes the article [https://cq-ops.tumblr.com/post/145714997699/how-to-verify-that-binary-less-replication-is](https://cq-ops.tumblr.com/post/145714997699/how-to-verify-that-binary-less-replication-is)

One of the up-sides to using a shared data (Binary Large Object - BLOB) store (file or S3) is that the replication can then be set to <b>binary-less,</b> meaning the BLOB itself does not have to be transported across the network. Below are the steps to verify that it actually works:



1. Create a new <b>Apache Sling Logging Logger</b> configuration on the target *publish* instance (/system/console/configMgr) for com.day.cq.replication at the DEBUG level) - click on image for a larger version.

2. Activate an asset
3. Watch for the following type of entry in */logs/replication.log*


\*DEBUG\* 127.0.0.1 1465577645518 POST /bin/receive HTTP/1.1 com.day.cq.replication.impl.content.durbo.DurboImportTransformer property jcr:data of NodeNodeDelegate{tree=/content/dam/adobetest2/iPhone_6s_Plus-4K-video.MOV/jcr:content/renditions/original/jcr:content: { jcr:primaryType = nt:resource, jcr:uuid = ae912ae7-c808-4798-b723-31af557b1ab3, jcr:lastModifiedBy = admin, jcr:data = {840751500 bytes}, jcr:lastModified = 2016-06-10T12:54:06.667-04:00}} <b>set using a reference</b>

The key is the string *set using a reference* - it confirms that binary-less replication has been used. Thanks to [@tteofili](https://twitter.com/tteofili) for this pointer.
