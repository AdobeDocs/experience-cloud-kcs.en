# How to verify binary-less replication is working | AEM

## Description


How to verify that binary-less replication is working.


## Resolution


Copying blog in case author deletes the article [https://cq-ops.tumblr.com/post/145714997699/how-to-verify-that-binary-less-replication-is](https://cq-ops.tumblr.com/post/145714997699/how-to-verify-that-binary-less-replication-is)

One of the up-sides to using a shared data (BLOB) store (file or S3) is that replication can then be set to “binary-less” meaning the BLOB itself does not have to be transported across the network. Here are steps to verifying that it actually works:

1) Create a new [!DNL Apache Sling] Logging Logger configuration on the target “publish” instance (/system/console/configMgr) for com.day.cq.replication at the DEBUG level) - click on image for a larger version.

&#x200B;2) Activate an asset

&#x200B;3) Watch for the following type of entry in /logs/replication.log

\*DEBUG\* 127.0.0.1 1465577645518 POST /bin/receive HTTP/1.1 com.day.cq.replication.impl.content.durbo.DurboImportTransformer property jcr:data of NodeNodeDelegate{tree=/content/dam/adobetest2/iPhone_6s_Plus-4K-video.MOV/jcr:content/renditions/original/jcr:content: { jcr:primaryType = nt:resource, jcr:uuid = ae912ae7-c808-4798-b723-31af557b1ab3, jcr:lastModifiedBy = admin, jcr:data = {840751500 bytes}, jcr:lastModified = 2016-06-10T12:54:06.667-04:00}} <b>set using a reference</b>

The key is the string “set using a reference” - it confirms that binary-less replication has been used. Thanks to [@tteofili](https://twitter.com/tteofili) for this pointer.
