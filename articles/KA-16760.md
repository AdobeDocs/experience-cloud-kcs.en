# How to verify binary-less replication is working | AEM


In this document you will explore the steps to verifying whether binary-less replication is working or not in Adobe Experience Manager.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager 6.5



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

How to verify whether *binary-less replication* is working?


## Resolution {#resolution}


One of the up-sides to using a shared data (BLOB) store (file or S3) is that replication can then be set to *binary-less*, meaning the BLOB itself does not have to be transported across the network. Here are steps to verifying that it actually works:

1. Create a new <b>Apache Sling Logging Logger</b> configuration on the target *publish* instance (/system/console/configMgr) forÂ com.day.cq.replication at the DEBUG level) - click on image for a larger version.<br>

2. Activate an asset


3. Watch for the following type of entry in */logs/replication.log*

    *\*DEBUG\* `[` 127.0.0.1 `[` 1465577645518`]`  POST /bin/receive HTTP/1.1`]`  com.day.cq.replication.impl.content.durbo.DurboImportTransformer property jcr:data of Node`[` NodeDelegate{tree=/content/dam/adobetest2/iPhone_6s_Plus-4K-video.MOV/jcr:content/renditions/original/jcr:content: { jcr:primaryType = nt:resource, jcr:uuid = ae912ae7-c808-4798-b723-31af557b1ab3, jcr:lastModifiedBy = admin, jcr:data = {840751500 bytes}, jcr:lastModified = 2016-06-10T12:54:06.667-04:00}}`]`<b>set using a reference.*


The key is the string *set using a reference*- it confirms that binary-less replication has been used.
