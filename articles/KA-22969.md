How to send an email with an attachment in Adobe Campaign Classic v8?


## Resolution {#resolution}

<b>Follow these steps:</b>
- To send an email with an attachment, you need to create a delivery template on the <b>Marketing instance</b> that includes the attachment.

     If you don't create this template, you won't be able to send an email with an attachment.


    
- Also, one can create a typology rule for type control in the Messaging Centre (MC) instance and return false if the flag *@hasAttachments* is set during delivery.
- Here is an example that can be adapted to your specific scenario. Please note that this is only a guideline.

    


    ```
    if (delivery.hasAttachments)
    
        {     logError(“The delivery has an attachment which is not authorised as per our policy”);     return false; }
        else
    
        return true;
    ```
