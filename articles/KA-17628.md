<br>Published Server Name is Content Deliver Network (CDN) server used in all system-generated URL calls specific to your Dynamic Media account.<br><br> <br><br>![](assets/___9c388241-274e-ec11-8c62-00224804e5cb___.png)<br><br> <br><br>Make sure, your custom domain name is either mapped to Adobe’s CDN Server or in case you are using your own CDN Provider’s domain name, it should be mapped to our [!UICONTROL Origin Server\*]
