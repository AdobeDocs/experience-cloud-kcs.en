# Clicking "Adobe Experience Manager" in the left top corner to go to the main navigation screen opens the "Assets" view


Irrespective of the screen selected, clicking on "Adobe Experience Manager" in the left top corner to go to the main navigation screen always opens the "Assets" view instead of the main one.

## Description {#description}

After further investigation, it was found that the customer was using the Global Navigation - `[` 1`]`  from a location inside Assets<br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>`[` 1`]`  [https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/sites/authoring/getting-started/basic-handling.html?lang=en#global-navigation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/sites/authoring/getting-started/basic-handling.html?lang=en#global-navigation)

## Resolution {#resolution}


The experienced behavior is as designed.

When the global navigation is accessed from the assets page, it should show the asset console with options like files, collections, etc.
If it is accessed from sites or any other path, the home page with options like sites, assets, projects, etc is displayed.
