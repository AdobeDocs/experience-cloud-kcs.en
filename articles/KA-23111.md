# Clicking "Adobe Experience Manager" in top left corner to go to main navigation screen opens "Assets" view


When[Global Navigation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/sites/authoring/getting-started/basic-handling.html?lang=en#global-navigation) is used from a location inside Assets, clicking on <b>Adobe Experience Manager</b> in the top left corner to go to the main navigation screen always opens the *Assets* view instead of the main one. It is an expected behavior.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Experience Manager

### Issue/Symptoms

Irrespective of the selected screen, clicking on Adobe Experience Manager in the top left corner to go to the main navigation screen always opens the Assets view instead of the main one. This happens when Global Navigation is used from a location inside Assets.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The experienced behavior is as designed. When the global navigation is accessed from the assets page, it should show the asset console with options like files, collections, etc. If it is accessed from sites or any other path, the home page with options like sites, assets, projects, etc. is displayed.
