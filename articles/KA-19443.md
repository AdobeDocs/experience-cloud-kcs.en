# Unable to edit serialize checkbox for URL destination

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Audience Manager

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Unable to edit serialize checkbox option for URL destination.
![http://omniture.custhelp.com/ci/inlineImage/get/2436941/8ec1fd470496113012e39f003147071b](http://omniture.custhelp.com/ci/inlineImage/get/2436941/8ec1fd470496113012e39f003147071b)

## Resolution {#resolution}


To resolve this, select the serialize option right at the time of URL destination creation.

<b>Cause</b>

Once a serialization configuration is saved in the Create workflow for URL destination, the UI does not allow a user to edit it. Since every URL is different, we canâ€™t modify it after creation because AAM doesn't know how to handle already provided mappings value dynamically. This may mess up the URLs and cause issues in segment datashare.
