# Unable to edit serialize checkbox for URL destination

## Description

Unable to edit Serialize check box option for URL destination.<br><br> <br><br>![http://omniture.custhelp.com/ci/inlineImage/get/2436941/8ec1fd470496113012e39f003147071b](http://omniture.custhelp.com/ci/inlineImage/get/2436941/8ec1fd470496113012e39f003147071b)

## Resolution


<b>Root cause</b>: Once a serialization configuration is saved in the Create workflow for URL destination, the UI don’t allow a user to edit it. Since every URL is different, we can’t modify it after creation because AAM doesn't know how to handle already provided mappings value dynamically. The URLs would very likely get messed up and cause issues in segment datashare.

<b>Solution</b>: To do this, select the [!UICONTROL serialize] option right at the time of URL destination creation.
