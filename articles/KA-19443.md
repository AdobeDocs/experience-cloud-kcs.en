# Unable to edit serialize checkbox for URL destination

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

- Adobe Audience Manager

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Unable to edit serialize checkbox option for URL destination.
<br><br> <br><br>![http://omniture.custhelp.com/ci/inlineImage/get/2436941/8ec1fd470496113012e39f003147071b](http://omniture.custhelp.com/ci/inlineImage/get/2436941/8ec1fd470496113012e39f003147071b)

## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Cause</b>

Once a serialization configuration is saved in the Create workflow for URL destination, the UI does not allow a user to edit it. Since every URL is different, we can’t modify it after creation because AAM doesn't know how to handle already provided mappings value dynamically. This may mess up the URLs and cause issues in segment datashare.

<b>Solution</b>

To resolve this, select the serialize option right at the time of URL destination creation.
