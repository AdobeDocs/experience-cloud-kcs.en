# Activity are not tracking visitors, when qualifying for it

## Description


Scenario :

XT activity using Geo audiences is showing 0 visitors  into the activity since past 2 weeks, when it was made live. When I am testing the activity from activity URL, I am qualifying for the activity and getting counted in the reports also
But the question here is why the other visitors not getting counted into the activity? As per analytics , page had 100 visitors on the activity page


## Resolution


This may be happening if

1. URL isn't normally available for normal visitors when browsing the site

2. Activity URL might not be exactly same as the webpage. For example, activity is created on [!DNL https]://abc.com , however when navigating through the website, it takes you to https://www.abc.com

In above scenarios, the actual website visitors would not be able to qualify for the activity and hence would not be tracked in Target activity reports but may still be available in Analytics.
