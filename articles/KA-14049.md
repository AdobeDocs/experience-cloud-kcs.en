# Activity not tracking qualifying visitors

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
Target
<br><br>Issue/Symptoms<br><br>
XT Activity using Geo audiences has been showing zero visitors in the Activity since the past two weeks when it was made live. When testing Activity from the activity URL, I am qualifying for the Activity and getting counted in the reports.



But other visitors are not getting counted in the Activity. As per analytics, the page had 100 visitors on the Activity page.
<br><br> <br>

## Resolution {#resolution}


This may be happening if:

- URL isn’t normally available for normal visitors when browsing the site.
- The activity URL might not be the same as the webpage. For example, Activity is created on https://abc.com. However, when navigating through the website, it takes you to https://www.abc.com.


In the above scenarios, the actual website visitors would not be able to qualify for the Activity and hence would not be tracked in Target Activity reports but may still be available in Analytics.
