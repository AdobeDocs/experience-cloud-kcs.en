# Campaign Classic - Error on workflow instance 'Recovery of web events'

## Description


The `webAnalyticsGetWebEvents` Workflow is failing with the error, "[!UICONTROL You do not have access to view this request]‚Äù.


## Resolution


Due to recent changes to the environment, segment ID's got corrupted, they are not properly synchronized between two products.

There are two solutions to this problem:

1. Locate all corrupted segment ID's ([!DNL Analytics] Support can help here), and put <b>0(zero)</b> in their `requestId=""` inside `NmsWebSegments_LastStates`. Save it.

    Rerun workflow again. You will get calculation incomplete warnings however this is normal and should resolve once the calculation on the data warehouse side completes.




1. Reset `NmsWebSegments_LastStates`. It will set the option `NmsWebSegments_LastStates` value blank. Rerun workflow to pull <b>all segments again</b> with new ID's.




The recommended approach is to use the first option.
