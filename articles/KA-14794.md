# Error on workflow instance 'Recovery of web events'


Learn how to solve the <b>webAnalyticsGetWebEvents</b> workflow issue where segment IDs get corrupted and are not synchronized correctly between two products.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment </b>

Campaign Classic



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

The <b>`webAnalyticsGetWebEvents` </b>workflow is failing with the <b>error: `you do not have access to view this request`.</b>


## Resolution {#resolution}


Due to recent changes to the environment, segment IDs are corrupted and are not synchronized correctly between two products.

There are two solutions to this problem:

<b>Solution One:</b>

1. Locate all corrupted segment IDs (Analytics Support can help here), and put <b>`0(zero)`</b> in their requestId="" inside <b>`NmsWebSegments_LastStates`</b>. Save it.

    Rerun workflow again. You will get *calculation incomplete* warnings however this is normal and should resolve once the calculation on the data warehouse side completes.


<b>Solution Two:</b>

1. Reset <b>`NmsWebSegments_LastStates`</b>. It will set the option <b>`NmsWebSegments_LastStates`</b> value blank. Rerun workflow to pull all segments again with new IDs.




<b>*Note: The recommended approach is to use the first option.</b>*
