# Campaign Classic - Error on workflow instance 'Recovery of web events'

## Description

<br>Environment <br><br>
Campaign Classic
<br><br>Issue/Symptoms<br><br>
The <b>`webAnalyticsGetWebEvents`Â </b>workflow is failing with the error *you do not have access to view this request*.


## Resolution


Due to recent changes to the environment, segment IDs got corrupted, they are not properly synchronized between two products.

There are two solutions to this problem:

Solution One:

1. Locate all corrupted segment IDs (Analytics Support can help here), and put <b>`0(zero)`</b> in their requestId="" inside <b>`NmsWebSegments_LastStates`</b>. Save it.

    Rerun workflow again. You will get *calculation incomplete* warnings however this is normal and should resolve once the calculation on the data warehouse side completes.


Solution Two:

1. Reset <b>`NmsWebSegments_LastStates`</b>. It will set the option <b>`NmsWebSegments_LastStates`</b> value blank. Rerun workflow to pull all segments again with new IDs.




The recommended approach is to use the first option.
