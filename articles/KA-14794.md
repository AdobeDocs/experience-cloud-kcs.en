# Campaign Classic - Error on workflow instance 'Recovery of web events'

## Description


The <b>webAnalyticsGetWebEvents </b>Workflow is failing with the error, "you do not have access to view this request‚Äù.


## Resolution


Due to recent changes to the environment, segment ID's got corrupted, they are not properly synchronized between two products.

There are two solutions to this problem:

1. Locate all corrupted segment ID's (Analytics Support can help here), and put <b>0(zero)</b> in their requestId="" inside <b>NmsWebSegments_LastStates</b>. Save it.

    Rerun workflow again. You will get calculation incomplete warnings however this is normal and should resolve once the calculation on the data warehouse side completes.




1. Reset <b>NmsWebSegments_LastStates</b>. It will set the option <b>NmsWebSegments_LastStates</b> value blank. Rerun workflow to pull <b>all segments again</b> with new ID's.




The recommended approach is to use the first option.
