# Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service: Which commit of custom code will be deployed during the automated update

## Description


AEM as a Cloud Service performs the automated update through a production pipeline execution of Cloud Manager. At that time, the same pipeline execution deploys custom code in addition to a new AEM release.

This article explains which commit of custom code is used during the automated update.

<b>Environment:</b>
 AEM as a Cloud Service


## Resolution


The production pipeline for the automated update uses custom code with the last git tag successfully deployed to production. It does not mean the most recent commit, so you don't have to worry about exposing your latest custom code under development on production.
