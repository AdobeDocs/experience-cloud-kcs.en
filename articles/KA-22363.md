# How to fix error when using .woff and .woff2 extensions?

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Classic v7 (Release 7.2.2 - Build 9349)

### Issue/Symptoms

After you whitelist .woff and .woff2 on a mid instance, and use these file extensions in a web app, the following error is thrown:


```
Access to font at 'https://mkt-instance.campaign.adobe.com/res/mid-instance/file_example.woff2'
    from origin 'https://mkt-instance.campaign.adobe.com' has been blocked by 
    CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```


<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Access the URL of the web app using .woff and .woff2 files.
2. Open the browser console of your web browser, and notice the error for these files.



## Resolution {#resolution}


1. Add `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`, and `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` as responseHeader under the relay section of the `serverConf.xml`:    ![](assets/02ae0a1c-2515-ee11-8f6e-6045bd0067ea.png)
2. Add `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`, and `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` headers on `apache_neolane.conf` on both app containers:    ![](assets/f7215128-2515-ee11-8f6e-6045bd0067ea.png)
3. Once the two files have been saved, do a clean nlserver and apache restart on all containers of the instance.


### Cause

The error is thrown because the mid instance was missing the configuration of `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`, and `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` headers on `serverConf.xml` and on `apache_neolane.conf`.
