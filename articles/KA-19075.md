# Can Segue be used to integrate multiple Experience Platform sandboxes with Audience Manager?

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
 Multiple Experience Platform (AEP) Sandboxes
 Adobe Audience Manager

<b>Issue</b>
 Is it possible to useÂ Segue to integrate multiple AEP sandboxes with Audience Manager to allow data sharing between AEP and Audience Manager?


## Resolution {#resolution}


Segue does not support the integration of multiple AEP sandboxes with Audience Manager. You can switch between sandboxes but cannot sync to more than one sandbox at a time.
