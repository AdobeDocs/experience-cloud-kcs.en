# Is it possible to use Segue to integrate multiple Experience Platform sandboxes with Audience Manager?

## Description {#description}

<br>Environment<br><br>
- Multiple Experience Platform (AEP) Sandboxes
- Using Segue to allow data sharing between AEP and  Audience Manager

Issue
- Want to use Seque to integrate multiple AEP sandboxes with Audience Manager



## Resolution {#resolution}


Segue does not support the integration of multiple AEP sandboxes with Audience Manager. You can switch between sandboxes but cannot sync to more than one sandbox at a time.
