Learn how to integrate multiple Adobe Experience Platform sandboxes with Audience Manager.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

- Multiple Experience Platform (AEP) Sandboxes
- Adobe Audience Manager


### Issue/Symptoms

Is it possible to use Segue to integrate multiple AEP sandboxes with Audience Manager to allow data sharing between AEP and Audience Manager?


## Resolution {#resolution}


Segue does not support the integration of multiple AEP sandboxes with Audience Manager. You can switch between sandboxes but cannot sync to more than one sandbox at a time.
