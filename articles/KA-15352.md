# Adobe Campaign: Advanced Filter is case-sensitive

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Campaign Classic

<b>Issue</b>
 When searching on recipients using the <b>Advanced Filter</b> option that recipients could not be found.

<b>Cause</b>
 This turned out to be due to the <b>Advanced Filter</b> in build 9032 forcing case-sensitivity when performing queries.


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>

The only option is to use other filtering methods, or to ensure that the capitalization in the advanced query matches the record that is being looked for.

Additionally NEO-23240 was created to review this issue and was determined to be working as designed.
