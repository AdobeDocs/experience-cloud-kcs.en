# Customer/CRM IDs in AAM Using Platform Web SDK

## Description {#description}


How are Customer or CRM IDs passed to AAM when using the AEP Web SDK?


## Resolution {#resolution}


Use the AEP Identity Namespace symbol from the Identities UI for the corresponding AAM Cross-Device Data source in the Identity Map of the Web SDK. Not sure how AEP Identity Namespaces and and AAM Cross-Device Data sources are related? See [this article](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-cloud-kcs/kbarticles/KA-21305.html)
