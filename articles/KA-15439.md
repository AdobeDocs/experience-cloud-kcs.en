```


<b>Cause</b>
 Some missing JAR (Java Archive) files are reported by the WEB process.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The `classpath` tag from the `serverConf.xml` configuration file has not been updated correctly after the upgrade.

The `classpath` tag should point to the latest JARs.
