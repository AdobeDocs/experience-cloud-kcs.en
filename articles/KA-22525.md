# Admin users not notified of errors in OOTB ffdaReplicateStagingData workflow

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Classic v8

### Issue/Symptoms

As an Admin user, you are not notified when there are errors in the OOTB `ffdaReplicateStagingData` workflow.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. Open the <b>Properties</b> window of the workflow `ffdaReplicateStagingData`.
2. In the <b>General</b> tab, set up a Supervisor.
3. In the <b>Execution</b> tab, under <b>Error management</b>, set the *In case of error* field to *Suspend the process*.
4. Save the workflow.


Now, in case an error shows up in the workflow, the Supervisor  that you have set up should receive an e-mail notification about it.

### Cause

This OOTB workflow does not have a Supervisor set up by default. Further, the *In case of error<b> </b>*field is set to *Ignore* at the workflow properties level.
