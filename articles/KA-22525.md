# Admin users not notified of errors in OOTB ffdaReplicateStagingData workflow


Learn how to resolve the OOTB ffdaReplicateStagingData issue where the user is not notified when there are errors in the workflow due to Supervisor set up by default.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Classic v8

### Issue/Symptoms

An Admin user, is not notified when there are errors in the OOTB `ffdaReplicateStagingData` workflow.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. Open the <b>Properties</b> window of the workflow `ffdaReplicateStagingData`.
2. In the <b>General</b> tab, set up a <b>Supervisor.</b>
3. In the <b>Execution</b> tab, under <b>Error management</b>, set the <b>*In case of error</b>* field to <b>*Suspend the process*.</b>
4. Save the workflow.


Now, in case an error shows up in the workflow, the Supervisor  that a user has set up should receive an email notification about it.

### Cause

This OOTB workflow does not have a Supervisor set up by default. Further, the *In case of error<b> </b>*field is set to *Ignore* at the workflow properties level.
