# Page throws NullPointerException upon activation in AEM sites


When a page is activated in Adobe Experience Manager, the activation fails with a `NullPointException` message due to a missing `cq:lastReplicated` property in one of the referenced images. Follow the steps outlined in this article to resolve the issue.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Experience Manager 6.x





### Issue/Symptoms

When a page is activated in AEM, the activation fails with the following exception:


```
javax.servlet.ServletException: java.lang.NullPointerException
at com.day.cq.wcm.core.impl.reference.ActivationReferenceSearchServlet.doGet(ActivationReferenceSearchServlet.java:175)
at org.apache.sling.api.servlets.SlingSafeMethodsServlet.mayService(SlingSafeMethodsServlet.java:269)
```



<b>Cause</b>
<br>One of the images referenced by the page had an issue with its properties.


The image causing issues was missing the `cq:lastReplicated` property while it had the `cq:lastReplicatedBy` and `cq:lastReplicationAction` properties.

  
<b>Specified Messages</b>


```
javax.servlet.ServletException: java.lang.NullPointerException
at com.day.cq.wcm.core.impl.reference.ActivationReferenceSearchServlet.doGet
at org.apache.sling.api.servlets.SlingSafeMethodsServlet.mayService
```



## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Resolution</b>

1. Identify all the images which have this conflict:

    ```
    SELECT * FROM [ dam:Asset]  AS parent INNER JOIN [ nt:base]  AS child ON ISCHILDNODE(child, parent) WHERE ISDESCENDANTNODE(parent, '/content/dam/journey/') AND child.[ cq:lastReplicated]  IS NULL AND child.[ cq:lastReplicatedBy]  IS NOT NULL
    ```


2. Once the assets are identified, check if these assets were replicated or not.
3. If <b>Yes</b>, add the property `cq:lastReplicated` with the type <b>Date</b> and copy the date from the publish server.
4. In either case, you can remove the `cq:lastReplicatedBy` and `cq:lastReplicatedAction` properties and activate the image again.
