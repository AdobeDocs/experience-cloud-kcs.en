# Page is throwing NullPointerException upon activation in AEM Sites

## Description


<b>Issue </b>
When a page is activated in AEM, the activation fails with the following exception


```
javax.servlet.ServletException: java.lang.NullPointerException
at com.day.cq.wcm.core.impl.reference.ActivationReferenceSearchServlet.doGet(ActivationReferenceSearchServlet.java:175)
at org.apache.sling.api.servlets.SlingSafeMethodsServlet.mayService(SlingSafeMethodsServlet.java:269)
```


<b>Environment</b>
AEM 6.x
<b>Cause </b>
This was happening because one of the images referenced by the page had an issue with it's properties. The image causing issues was missing the cq:lastReplicated property while it had the cq:lastReplicatedBy and cq:lastReplicationAction properties.

 
<b>Specified Message </b>
javax.servlet.ServletException: java.lang.NullPointerException
at com.day.cq.wcm.core.impl.reference.ActivationReferenceSearchServlet.doGet
at org.apache.sling.api.servlets.SlingSafeMethodsServlet.mayService


## Resolution


1) Identify all the images which have this conflict


```
SELECT * FROM dam:Asset AS parent INNER JOIN nt:base AS child ON ISCHILDNODE(child,parent) WHERE ISDESCENDANTNODE(parent, '/content/dam/journey/') AND child.cq:lastReplicated IS NULL AND child.cq:lastReplicatedBy IS NOT NULL
```


2) Once the assets are identified, check if these assets were actually replicated or not. 

3) If yes, you can add the property cq:lastReplicated with the type Date and copy the date from the publish server.

4) In either case, you can remove the [!UICONTROL cq:lastReplicatedBy] and [!UICONTROL cq:lastReplicatedAction] properties and Activate the image once again.
