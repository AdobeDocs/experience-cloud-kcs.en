# Adobe Campaign: ODBC syntax or semantic analysis error is thrown when attempting to extend a schema on a Hadoop table

## Description



















It has been reported with Campaign clients using the Hadoop connector, that when they attempt to extend a schema on a Hadoop table that an error like the following is produced.

ODB-240000 ODBC error: [Hortonworks][Hardy](80) Syntax or semantic analysis error thrown in server while executing query.
Error message from server: Error while compiling statement:
FAILED: ParseException line 1:66 missing EOF at ‘)’ near ‘eflyer_email_addr’ SQLState: 37000
WDB-200001 SQL statement ‘SELECT Concat(C0.campaign_email_nm,’,’), C0.eflyer_email_addr),’,’), C0.language_preference_cd), C0.campaign_email_nm, C0.eflyer_email_addr, C0.language_preference_cd FROM campaign_mgmt_encrypted_im.campaign_eflyer_loyalty_open_clicks_fct C0’ could not be executed.
 























## Resolution

At this time multiple vendors can't be added to the same external account.  An enhancement has been created in NEO-20192 for this functionality to be evaluated for a future release.
