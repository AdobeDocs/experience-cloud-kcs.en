# Troubleshoot login issues in Analytics

## Description {#description}

The following are the common scenarios which might impact login to Adobe Analytics.<br><br> <br><br> 

## Resolution {#resolution}


- Ensure that the user account is not expired. The expiration date can be checked in Admin - Analytics Users & Assets in the Analytics UI.
- Ensure that the user account is created in Adobe Analytics. As the user account is created in the Experience Cloud Admin Console and Analytics product profiles assigned to it, it should create a user account in Analytics too.
- If the login to the Experience Cloud (experience.adobe.com) works fine but the login to Analytics throws an error, try switching off browser extensions, and clearing cache/cookies once.
- Check if the login behavior persists in a different browser and/or a different network (on/off VPN).
- Go to Admin - Analytics Users & Assets and find the user in the Analytics UI. See if it is mapped to the Experience Cloud. In case of any issues, reach out to Adobe Customer Care for more information.
