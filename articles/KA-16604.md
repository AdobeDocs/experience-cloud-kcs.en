# "Compare Time Period" not available in Analysis Workspace

## Description


Why the "Compare Time Period" feature might not be available in Analysis Workspace?


## Resolution


The [!UICONTROL “Compare Time Period”] feature in Analysis Workspace is only available for companies with SKUs having Advanced Calculated Metrics. In other words, they are available for the companies on the Select, Prime, and Ultimate SKUs, by default. It's not available for companies on the "Foundation" SKU.

Additionally, it’s not available when the time-related components (Day, Month, etc.) are added as dimensions.
