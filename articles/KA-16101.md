# How to fetch long running workflow in ACS using workflowTask table


Monitoring the duration of long-running workflow activities can help improve performance and maintain a healthy database. This article explains how to fetch long-running workflows in Adobe Campaign Standard using the *workflowTask* table.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Campaign Standard

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

When you set alerts for failed workflows, you may miss out on workflows that have been running for a very long time due to stuck-up activities or activities processing for days on an ACS instance. This results in degraded performance and high database consumption.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Workflow task details can be fetched from the `xtk:workflowTask` table.Â The *Workflow Task* table contains information related to workflow activities and their run duration.

<b>How to ensure awareness of long-running workflow activities?</b>

This can be achieved using a simple workflow. Follow the steps below to create a workflow to monitor the long-running workflow activities:

1. Create a new workflow.
2. Select a query activity.
3. Select the Resource and Targeting dimension as: `WorkflowTaskDetail (xtk:workflow task:workflowTaskDetail)`
4. Now, in the Target section, use the below queries:
    - Duration is more significant than 3600.
    - Activity name does not start with a schedule.
    - Activity name does not begin with signal.


The above workflow creation would help you fetch those activities running for more than 1 hour.

Setting an alert to this query condition can help you monitor the running workflow activities for a long duration.

<b>Note:</b> In the duration condition, set the time duration in seconds and not in minutes or hours.
