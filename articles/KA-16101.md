# [!DNL Campaign] - How to fetch long running workflow activities in ACS using workflowTask table

## Description

Workflow Task Duration<br><br>
Workflow Task details can be fetched from `xtk:workflowTask` table.

Clients usually set alerts for failed workflows but they often miss out on those workflows that have been running for a very long time due to stuck activities or activities processing for days on ACS instances.
This usually results in degraded performance and high DB consumption.


Workflow Task table contains information related to workflow activities and their run duration.

Monitoring the duration of activities can help overcome such situations and help maintain a healthy DB.


## Resolution

How to ensure awareness of long-running workflow activities<br><br>
This can be achieved using a simple workflow. Below are the details of the workflow that can be created by clients to monitor long-running workflow activities:

- Create a new workflow

- Select a query activity

- Select the Resource and Targeting dimension as: `WorkflowTaskDetail (xtk:workflow task:workflowTaskDetail)`

- Now, in the [!UICONTROL Target] section, use the below queries:

Duration is more significant than 3600

AND

Activity name does not start with a schedule

AND

Activity name does not begin with signal



This would help fetch those activities running for more than 1 hour.

Setting an alert to this query condition can help clients monitor the running activities for a long duration.

NOTE: In the duration condition, please make sure the time duration you set is in seconds and not in minutes or hours.
