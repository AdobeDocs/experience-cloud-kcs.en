# How to fetch long running workflow in ACS using workflowTask table


Learn how to fetch long running workflow in ACS using workflow Task table.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Campaign Standard

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Fetching Workflow Task duration details.

When you set alerts for failed workflows, you may miss out on those workflows that have been running for a very long time due to the stuck-up activities or activities processing for days on ACS instance. This results in a degraded performance and high database consumption.


## Resolution {#resolution}


*Workflow Task* table contains information related to workflow activities and their run durations. Monitoring the duration of activities can help improve the performance and maintain a healthy database.

Workflow Task details can be fetched from `xtk:workflowTask` table.
<br>How to ensure awareness of long-running workflow activities<br>
This can be achieved using a simple workflow. Follow the steps below to create a workflow to monitor the long-running workflow activities:

1. Create a new workflow

2. Select a query activity

3. Select the Resource and Targeting dimension as: <b>WorkflowTaskDetail</b> <b>(xtk:workflow task:workflowTaskDetail)</b>

4. Now, in the Target section, use the below queries:

Duration is more significant than 3600

AND

Activity name does not start with a schedule

AND

Activity name does not begin with signal



Above workflow creation would help you fetch those activities running for more than 1 hour.

Setting an *alert* to this query condition can help the clients monitor the running workflow activities for a long duration.

<b>NOTE:</b> In the duration condition, please ensure you set the time duration in seconds and not in minutes or hours.
