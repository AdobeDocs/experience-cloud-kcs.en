# Unknown Identity Namespaces

## Description {#description}

Why are there non-standard identity namespaces that we didn't create in the AEP Identities UI?

## Resolution {#resolution}


What you may be seeing are Audience Manager Cross-Device data sources that created their correlating AEP Identity Namespace. Not sure how AEP Identity Namespaces and AAM Cross-Device Data sources are connected? See [this article](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-cloud-kcs/kbarticles/KA-21305.html)
