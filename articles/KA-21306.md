# Unknown identity namespaces

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- Audience Manager
- Experience Platform




<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
<br>Why are there non-standard identity namespaces that we didn't create in the Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) Identities User Interface (UI)?<br>

## Resolution {#resolution}


What you may be seeing are Audience Manager Cross-Device data sources that created their correlating AEP Identity Namespace. To know more about how AEP Identity Namespaces and AAM Cross-Device Data sources are connected? See [this article](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-cloud-kcs/kbarticles/KA-21305.html).
