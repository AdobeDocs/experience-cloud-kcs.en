# Unable to receive email proofs sent through a midsourcing instance

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Classic

### Issue/Symptoms

Each time an email proof passes through the Midsourcing 2 server, it is not being received on the intended email addresses. This seems to be happening only in the case of proofs.

When you have an on-premise environment setup with 2 containers, and both containers are running on the <b>mta</b> process, proofs and deliveries won't be sent if <b>mta</b> from container 2 is being used.

<b>Note:</b> The issue does not occur on using the <b>mta</b> from container 1.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Start a <b>stat</b> server on container 2 as well. This will allow the <b>mta</b> of container 2 to connect to it and send proofs and deliveries.

### Cause

A slow connection between the <b>mta</b> server of container 2 and the <b>stat</b> server of container 1 caused this issue.
