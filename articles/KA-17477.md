# Explanation of Configuration Files

## Description


This document will break down and explain each of the configuration files deployed in a standard built dispatcher server provisioned in Adobe Managed Services. Their use, naming convention, etc...




<br><br><br><br>Naming Convention<br><br><br><br> <br><br>
[!DNL Apache] Webserver doesn't actually care what the file extension is of a file when targeting it with an include or includeoptional statement.  Naming them properly with names that eliminate conflicts and confusion helps a ton. Names used will describe the scope of where the file is applied it makes life easier. If everything is named `.conf` this gets really confusing. We want to avoid poorly named files and extensions.  Below is a list of the different custom file extensions and naming conventions used in a typical AMS configured dispatcher.
<br><br><br><br> <br><br>Files contained in conf.d/<br><br>



| File | File Destination | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FILENAME.conf` | `/etc/httpd/conf.d/` | A default Enterprise [!DNL Linux] install uses this file extension and include folder as a place to override settings in `httpd.conf` and allow you to add addtional functionality at a global level in [!DNL Apache]. |
| `FILENAME.vhost` | Staged: `/etc/httpd/conf.d/available_vhosts/`<br><br>Active:<br><br>`/etc/httpd/conf.d/enabled_vhosts/`<br><br><u>*Note: `.vhost` files aren't to be copied into the `enabled_vhosts` folder but use symlinks to a relative path to the `available_vhosts/` `.vhost` file</u><br><br> | `\*.vhost` (Virtual Host) files are VirtualHosts  entries to match hostnames and allow [!DNL Apache] to handle each domain traffic with different rules. From the `.vhost` file, other files like rewrites, whitelisting, etc will be included. |
| `FILENAME_rewrite.rules` | `/etc/httpd/conf.d/rewrites/` | \*`_rewrite.rules` files store `mod_rewrite` rules to be included and consumed explicitly by a vhost file |
| `FILENAME_whitelist.rules` | `/etc/httpd/conf.d/whitelists/` | \*`_ipwhitelist.rules` files are included from inside the `\*.vhost` files. It contains IP regex or allow deny rules to allow IP whitelisting. If you're trying to restrict viewing of a virtual host based on IP addresses you'll generate one of these files and include it from your `\*.vhost` file |

<br><br><br> <br><br>Files contained in `conf.modules.d/`<br><br><br><br> <br>

| File | File Destination | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FILENAME.any` | `/etc/httpd/conf.dispatcher.d/` | The AEM Dispatcher [!DNL Apache] Module sources it's settings from `\*.any` files. The default parent include file is `conf.dispatcher.d/dispatcher.any` |
| `FILENAME_farm.any` | Staged:<br><br>`/etc/httpd/conf.dispatcher.d/available_farms/`<br><br>Active:<br><br>`/etc/httpd/conf.dispatcher.d/enabled_farms/`<br><br><u>*Note: these farm files aren't to be copied into the `enabled_farms` folder but use symlinks to a relative path to the `available_farms/` `_farm.any` file</u>\*`_farm.any` files are included inside the `conf.dispatcher.d/dispatcher.any` file. These parent farm files exist to control module behavior for each render or website type. Files are created in the `available_farms` directory and enabled with a symlink into the `enabled_farms` directory.<br><br><br><br>It auto-includes them by name from the `dispatcher.any` file.<br><br><br><br>Baseline farm files begin with 000_ to make sure they are loaded first.<br><br>Custom farm files should be loaded after by starting their number scheme at 100_ to assure the proper include behavior. |
| `FILENAME_filters.any` | `/etc/httpd/conf.dispatcher.d/filters/` | \*`_filters.any` files are included from inside the `conf.dispatcher.d/enabled_farms/\*_farm.any` files. Each farm has a set of rules that change what traffic should be filtered out and not make it to the renderers. |
| `FILENAME_vhosts.any` | `/etc/httpd/conf.dispatcher.d/vhosts/` | \*`_vhosts.any` files are included from inside the `conf.dispatcher.d/enabled_farms/\*_farm.any` files. These files are a list of hostnames or uri paths to be matched by blob matching to determine which renderer to use to serve that request |
| `FILENAME_cache.any` | `/etc/httpd/conf.dispatcher.d/cache/` | \*`_cache.any` files are included from inside the `conf.dispatcher.d/enabled_farms/\*_farm.any` files. These files specify which items are cached and which aren't |
| `FILENAME_invalidate_allowed.any` | `/etc/httpd/conf.dispatcher.d/cache/` | \*`_invalidate_allowed.any` files are included inside the `conf.dispatcher.d/enabled_farms/\*_farm.any` files. They specify which IP addresses are allowed to send flush and invalidation requests. |
| `FILENAME_clientheaders.any` | `/etc/httpd/conf.dispatcher.d/clientheaders/` | \*`_clientheaders.any` files are included inside the `conf.dispatcher.d/enabled_farms/\*_farm.any` files. They specify which client headers should be passed through to each renderer. |
| `FILENAME_renders.any` | `/etc/httpd/conf.dispatcher.d/renders/` | \*`_renders.an`y files are included inside the `conf.dispatcher.d/enabled_farms/\*_farm.any` files. They specify IP, port, and timeout settings for each renderer. A proper renderer can be a livecycle server or any AEM systems where the dispatcher can fetch / proxy the requests from |

<br><br><br> <br><br>Avoided Problems<br><br><br><br> <br><br>
When following the naming convention you can avoid some pretty easy to make mistakes that can have catastrophic results.  We will cover a few examples.
<br><br><br><br> <br><br>Problem Example<br><br><br><br> <br><br>
As a site Example for ExampleCo two configuration files were created by the developers of the dispatcher configurations.

<b>`/etc/httpd/conf.d/exampleco.conf`</b>
<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br>

| 1<br>  2<br>  3<br>  4<br>  5<br>  6<br>  7<br>  8<br>  9<br>  10 | `VirtualHost *:80` `    ` `ServerName  "exampleco"` `    ` `ServerAlias "www.exampleco.com"` `    ` `.......... SNIP ...............` `    ` `IfModule mod_rewrite.c` `        ` `ReWriteEngine   on` `        ` `LogLevel warn rewrite:trace1` `        ` `Include /etc/httpd/conf.d/rewrites/exampleco.conf` `    ` `/IfModule` `/VirtualHost` |
| --- | --- |

<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br>
<b>`/etc/httpd/conf.d/rewrites/exampleco.conf`</b>
<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br>

| 1<br>  2 | `RewriteRule /$ /content/exampleco/en.html PT,L` `RewriteRule /robots.txt$ /content/dam/exampleco/robots.txt PT,L` |
| --- | --- |

<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br>POTENTIAL DANGER<br><br><br><br> <br><br>
<b>The file names are the same</b>

If the vhost file is accidentally put in the rewrites folder and the rewrites file is put into the `vhosts` folder.  It would appear to be deployed by filename properly, yet [!DNL Apache] will throw an error and the problem will not be immediately apparent.

<b>How this typically becomes an issue</b>

If the two files are downloaded to the same location they can either overwrite themselves or make it indistinguishable making the deployment process a nightmare.

<b>The file extensions are the same and auto-include prone</b>

The file extensions are the same and uses auto-included extension that [!DNL Apache] will auto include any `.conf` files in many of it's default folders.

<b>How this typically becomes an issue</b>

If the `vhost` file with the extension of `.conf` is put in the `/etc/httpd/conf.d/` folder it will try and load it into memory on [!DNL Apache] which is typically ok, but if the rewrite rules file with the extension of `.conf` gets placed in the `/etc/httpd/conf.d/` folder, it will get auto-included and apply globally causing confusing and undesired results.






## Resolution


Name the files base on what they do and safely out of the auto-include rules namespace.

If it's a virtual host file name it with `.vhost` as the extension.

If it's a rewrite rule file, name it with `site_rewrite.rules` as the suffix and extension. This naming convention will make it clear which site it's for and that it's a set of rewrite rules.

If it's a IP whitelist rule file, name it `description_whitelist.rules` as the suffix and extension. This naming convention will give some description of what it's for and that it's a set of IP matching rules.

Using these naming conventions will avoid issues, if a file gets moved into an auto-include directory that it doesn't belong.

For example putting a file named with `.rules`, `.any`, or `.vhost` in the auto-include folder of `/etc/httpd/conf.d/` wouldn't have any affect.

If a deployment change request says "please deploy `exampleco_rewrite.rules` to production dispatchers", the person deploying the changes can already know that they aren't adding a new site, they're just updating rewrite rules as indicated by the filename.
<br><br><br><br> <br><br>Include Order<br><br><br><br> <br><br>
When extending functionality and configurations in [!DNL Apache] Webserver installed on Enterpise [!DNL Linux] you have some important include orders you'll want to understand
<br><br><br><br> <br><br>[!DNL Apache] Baseline Includes<br><br><br><br><br><br>![apache baseline include order.  apache binary starts with httpd.conf which does an includeoptional to the conf.d/*.conf and conf.modules.d/*.conf directories](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/kb/en/ams-dispatcher-manual/Apache-Webserver-Baseline-Includes.png "Apache-Webserver-Baseline-Includes")<br><br><br><br> <br><br>
As seen in the diagram above the httpd binary only looks to the httpd.conf file as it's configuration file.  That file contains the following statements in it:
<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br>

| `Include conf.modules.d/*.conf` `IncludeOptional conf.d/*.conf` |
| --- |

<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br>AMS Top Level Includes<br><br><br><br> <br><br>
When we applied our standard we added some additional file types and includes of our own.

Here is the AMS baseline directories and top level includes
![AMS Baseline includes start with a dispatcher_vhost.conf that will include any file with the *.vhost from the /etc/httpd/conf.d/enabled_vhosts/ directory.  Items in the /etc/httpd/conf.d/enabled_vhosts/ directory are symlinks to the actual configuration file that lives in /etc/httpd/conf.d/available_vhosts/](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/kb/en/ams-dispatcher-manual/Apache-Webserver-AMS-Baseline-Includes.png "Apache-Webserver-AMS-Baseline-Includes")<br><br><br><br> <br><br>
Building off [!DNL Apache]'s baseline we show how AMS created some addtional folders and top level includes for `conf.d` folders as well as module specific directories nested under *`/etc/httpd/conf.dispatcher.d/`*

When [!DNL Apache] loads it will pull in the <b>`/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/02-dispatcher.conf`</b> and that file will include the binary file <b>`/etc/httpd/modules/mod_dispatcher.so`</b> into it's running state.
<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br>

| 1 | `LoadModule dispatcher_module modules` `/mod_dispatcher` `.so` |
| --- | --- |

<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br>
To use the module in our *VirtualHost /* we drop a configuration file into *`/etc/httpd/conf.d/`<b>`* `</b>`named `<b>`dispatcher_vhost.conf`</b> and inside this file you'll see use setup the basic parameters needed for the module to work:
<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br>

| 1<br>  2<br>  3<br>  4 | `IfModule disp_apache2.c` `    ` `DispatcherConfig conf.dispatcher.d` `/dispatcher` `.any` `    ` `...SNIP...` ```/IfModule``` |
| --- | --- |

<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br>
As you can see above this includes the top level `dispatcher.any` file for our dispatcher module to pick up it's configuration files from <b>`/etc/httpd/conf.dispatcher.d/dispatcher.any`</b>

Pay attention to the contents of this file:
<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br>

| 1<br>  2<br>  3 | `/farms` `{` `    ` `$include` `"enabled_farms/*_farm.any"` `}` |
| --- | --- |

<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br>
The top level `dispatcher.any` file includes all of the enabled farm files that live in <b>`/etc/httpd/conf.dispatcher.d/enabled_farms/`</b> with the file name of <b>`FILENAME_farm.any`</b> which follows our standard naming convention.

Later in the <b>`dispatcher_vhost.conf`</b> file mentioned earlier we also do an include statement to enable each enabled virtual host files that live in <b>`/etc/httpd/conf.d/enabled_vhosts/`</b> with the filename of <b>`FILENAME.vhost`</b> which follows our standard naming convention.


<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br>

| 1 | `IncludeOptional /etc/httpd/conf.d/enabled_vhosts/*.vhost` |
| --- | --- |

<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br>
In each of our `.vhost` files you'll note the dispatcher module gets initialized as a default file handler for a directory.  Here is an example `.vhost` file to show the syntax:
<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br>

| 1<br>  2<br>  3<br>  4<br>  5<br>  6<br>  7<br>  8<br>  9<br>  10<br>  11<br>  12 | `VirtualHost *:80` `    ` `ServerName    "weretail"` `    ` `ServerAlias www.weretail.com weretail.com` `    ` `Directory /` `        ` `IfModule disp_apache2.c` `            ` `....SNIP....` `            ` `SetHandler dispatcher-handler` `        ` `/IfModule` `        ` `....SNIP....` `    ` `/Directory` `    ` `....SNIP....` `/VirtualHost` |
| --- | --- |

<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br>
After the top level includes resolve they have other sub includes that are worth mentioning.  Here is a high level diagram on how the farms and vhosts files include other sub elements
<br><br><br><br> <br><br>AMS Virtual Host Includes<br><br><br><br><br><br>![ams virtual hosts include sub items.  This picture shows how one .vhost file includes files from variables, whitelists, and rewrites folders](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/kb/en/ams-dispatcher-manual/Apache-Webserver-AMS-Vhost-Includes.png "Apache-Webserver-AMS-Vhost-Includes")<br><br><br><br> <br><br>
When any `.vhost` files from <b>`/etc/httpd/conf.d/availabled_vhosts/`</b> directory get symlinked into the <b>`/etc/httpd/conf.d/enabled_vhosts/`</b> directory they will be used in the running configuration.

The `.vhost` files have sub includes based on common pieces we have found.  Things like variables, whitelists, and rewrite rules.

The `.vhost` file will have include statements for each file based on where they need to be included in the `.vhost` file.  Here is an example syntax of a `.vhost` file as a good reference:
<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br>

| 1<br>  2<br>  3<br>  4<br>  5<br>  6<br>  7<br>  8<br>  9<br>  10<br>  11<br>  12<br>  13<br>  14<br>  15<br>  16<br>  17<br>  18 | `Include` `/etc/httpd/conf` `.d` `/variables/weretail` `.vars` `VirtualHost *:80` `    ` `ServerName   ` `"${MAIN_DOMAIN}"` `    ` `Directory /` `        ` `Include` `/etc/httpd/conf` `.d` `/whitelists/weretail` `*_whitelist.rules` `        ` `IfModule disp_apache2.c` `            ` `....SNIP....` `            ` `SetHandler dispatcher-handler` `        ` ```/IfModule``` `        ` `....SNIP....` `    ` ```/Directory``` `    ` `....SNIP....` `    ` `IfModule mod_rewrite.c` `        ` `ReWriteEngine   on` `        ` `LogLevel warn rewrite:trace1` `        ` `Include` `/etc/httpd/conf` `.d` `/rewrites/weretail_rewrite` `.rules` `    ` ```/IfModule``` ```/VirtualHost``` |
| --- | --- |

<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br>
As you can see in the above example there is an include for the variables needed in this configuration file that are later used.

Inside the file <b>`/etc/httpd/conf.d/variables/weretail.vars`</b> we can see what variables are defined:


<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br>

| 1 | `Define MAIN_DOMAIN dev.weretail.com` |
| --- | --- |

<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br>
You can also see a line that includes a list of `whitelist.rules` files that restrict who can view this content based on different whitelist criteria.  Lets look at the contents of one of the white list files <b>`/etc/httpd/conf.d/whitelists/weretail_mainoffice_whitelist.rules`</b>:
<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br>

| 1<br>  2<br>  3 | `RequireAny` `  ` `Require ip 192.150.16.0/23` `/RequireAny` |
| --- | --- |

<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br>
You can also see a line that includes a set of rewrite rules.  Let's take a look at the contents of the <b>`weretail_rewrite.rules`</b> file:
<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br>

| 1<br>  2<br>  3<br>  4<br>  5<br>  6 | `RewriteRule /robots.txt$ /content/dam/weretail/robots.txt NC,PT` `RewriteCond %{SERVER_NAME} brand1.weretail.net NC` `RewriteRule /favicon.ico$ /content/dam/weretail/favicon.ico NC,PT` `RewriteCond %{SERVER_NAME} brand2.weretail.com NC` `RewriteRule /sitemap.xml$ /content/weretail/general/sitemap.xml NC,PT` `RewriteRule /logo.jpg$ /content/dam/weretail/general/logo.jpg NC,PT` |
| --- | --- |

<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br>AMS Farm Includes<br><br><br><br><br><br>![<FILENAME>_farms.any will include sub .any files to complete a farm configuration.  In this picture you can see that a farm will include each top level section files cache, clientheaders, filters, renders, and vhosts .any files](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/kb/en/ams-dispatcher-manual/Apache-Webserver-AMS-Farm-Includes.png "Apache-Webserver-AMS-Farm-Includes")<br><br><br><br> <br><br>
When any `FILENAME_farm.any` files from <b>`/etc/httpd/conf.dispatcher.d/available_farms/`</b> directory get symlinked into the <b>`/etc/httpd/conf.dispatcher.d/enabled_farms/`</b> directory they will be used in the running configuration.

The farm files have sub includes based on [top level sections of the farm](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-dispatcher/using/configuring/dispatcher-configuration.html#defining-farms-farms) like cache, clientheaders, filters, renders, and vhosts.

The `FILENAME_farm.any` files will have include statements for each file based on where they need to be included in the farm file.  Here is an example syntax of a `FILENAME_farm.any` file as a good reference:
<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br>

| 1<br>  2<br>  3<br>  4<br>  5<br>  6<br>  7<br>  8<br>  9<br>  10<br>  11<br>  12<br>  13<br>  14<br>  15<br>  16<br>  17<br>  18<br>  19<br>  20<br>  21<br>  22<br>  23<br>  24<br>  25<br>  26<br>  27<br>  28<br>  29<br>  30<br>  31<br>  32 | `/weretailfarm { ` `    ` `/clientheaders {` `        ` `$include "/etc/httpd/conf.dispatcher.d/clientheaders/ams_publish_clientheaders.any"` `        ` `$include "/etc/httpd/conf.dispatcher.d/clientheaders/ams_common_clientheaders.any"` `    ` `}` `    ` `/virtualhosts {` `        ` `$include "/etc/httpd/conf.dispatcher.d/vhosts/weretail_vhosts.any"` `    ` `}` `    ` `/renders {` `        ` `$include "/etc/httpd/conf.dispatcher.d/renders/ams_publish_renders.any"` `    ` `}` `    ` `/filter {` `        ` `$include "/etc/httpd/conf.dispatcher.d/filters/ams_publish_filters.any"` `        ` `$include "/etc/httpd/conf.dispatcher.d/filters/weretail_search_filters.any"` `    ` `}` `    ` `....SNIP....` `    ` `/cache {` `        ` `....SNIP....` `        ` `/rules {` `            ` `$include "/etc/httpd/conf.dispatcher.d/cache/ams_publish_cache.any"` `        ` `}` `        ` `....SNIP....` `        ` `/allowedClients {` `            ` `/0000 {` `                ` `/glob "*.*.*.*"` `                ` `/type "deny"` `            ` `}` `            ` `$include "/etc/httpd/conf.dispatcher.d/cache/ams_publish_invalidate_allowed.any"` `        ` `}` `    ` `....SNIP....` `    ` `}` `}` |
| --- | --- |

<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br>
As you can see each section for the `weretail` farm instead of having all of the syntax needed it's instead using an include statement.

Let's look at the syntax of a few of these includes to get the idea of what each sub include would look like

<b>`/etc/httpd/conf.dispatcher.d/vhosts/weretail_publish_vhosts.any`</b>:
<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br>

| 1<br>  2<br>  3 | `"brand1.weretail.com"` `"brand2.weretail.com"` `"www.weretail.comf"` |
| --- | --- |


As you can see it's a new line seperated list of domain names that should render from this farm over the others.

Next let's look at the <b>`/etc/httpd/conf.dispatcher.d/filters/weretail_search_filters.any`Apache</b>:
<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br>

| 1<br>  2 | `/400 { /type "allow" /method "GET" /path "/bin/weretail/lists/*" /extension "json" }` `/401 { /type "allow" /method "POST" /path "/bin/weretail/search/' /extension "html" }` |
| --- | --- |
