# Journey fails at send message step using lookup fields for personalization

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
Adobe Journey Optimizer (AJO)


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
Journey fails at send message step when using lookup fields for personalization.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Check that the contextualized attributes in the email exist in the Unified Profile Service (UPS). You will need to do an API call to get the data. Do the following:

1. Review the event that triggered the journey on the impacted profile and note down the value of the relationship attribute.
2. Using the API call, do a [retrieveEntity](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-platform-apis/references/profile/#tag/Entities/operation/retrieveEntity) API call to the union schema corresponding to your reference schema using the value from step 1.
3. If the call returns no results, it means that the data is not in UPS. You need to ensure that the profile is enabled for the dataset where the data was ingested and that the data has been ingested after profile has been enabled. If the data was ingested before profile has been enabled, you will need to re-ingest the data.



<b>Cause</b>
Data ingested in a dataset before it is enabled for profile is not copied into UPS.
