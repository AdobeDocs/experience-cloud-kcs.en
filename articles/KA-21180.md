# Adobe Experience Manager: Dynamic Media publishes updated images immediately

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- AEM as a Cloud Service
- AEM 6.5
- Dynamic Media Scene7 Mode



<b>Issues/Symptoms</b>
When you upload an image to AEM with Dynamic Media Scene7 mode, AEM also sends the image to Dynamic Media.
 This article explains a pitfall related to this behavior.


## Resolution {#resolution}


AEM automatically uploads images to Dynamic Media even with "Upon Activation" configuration. When you update a published image with the same file name into AEM, the updated image will go public immediately.
Because the image content is overwritten while the published status is kept intact on Dynamic Media.
Due to this behavior, there is a possibility of unexpected image publication.

Example:
1. Upload a new image to AEM.
2. AEM automatically uploads the image to Dynamic Media. At this stage, the image is in unpublished status.
3. Publish the image on AEM.
4. Dynamic Media marks the image as published status.
5. Upload a new image with the same file name as a published image to AEM.
6. AEM automatically uploads the image to Dynamic Media. The image is overwritten. But it is already in published status on Dynamic Media.

If you need to review a new image before publishing, upload the image with a different name.
