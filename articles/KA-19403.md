# Invalid Token when triggering transactional messages

## Description


The following error may appear when making calls for Events in ACS to trigger an email:

{

"error_description": "No valid bindings were found for organization and technical account combination",

"error": "invalid_token"

}

Everything was working before., but now the JWT was being denied access and can happen when usingÂ Adobe IO integration


## Resolution


The public key uploaded for the Adobe Io integration was expired, as shown in the Adobe Io integration console. Replacing the public key and updating their JWT fixed the issue.
