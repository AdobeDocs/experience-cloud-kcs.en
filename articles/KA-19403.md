# Invalid Token when triggering transactional messages

## Description


The following error may appear when making calls for Events in ACS to trigger an email:

```
{

"error_description": "No valid bindings were found for organization and technical account combination",

"error": "invalid_token"

}
```

Everything was working before, but now the JWT was being denied access and can happen when usingÂ Adobe I/O integration


## Resolution


The public key uploaded for the Adobe I/O integration was expired, as shown in the Adobe I/O integration console. Replacing the public key and updating their JWT fixed the issue.
