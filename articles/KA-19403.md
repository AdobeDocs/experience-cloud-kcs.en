# Invalid token when triggering transactional messages

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Campaign Standard

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

The following error may appear when making calls for events in ACS to trigger an email:




```
{
```




`   "error_description": "No valid bindings were found for organization and technical account combination",`

`   "error": "invalid_token"`

`}`



While it was working fine before, the JSON Web Token (JWT) now is being denied access. This can occur when using Adobe IO integration.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The public key uploaded for the Adobe IO integration had expired, as can be seen in the Adobe IO integration console. Replacing the public key and updating its JWT fixed the issue.
