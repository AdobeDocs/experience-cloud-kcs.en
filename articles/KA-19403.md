# Invalid token when triggering transactional messages


This articles addresses the Adobe Campaign Standard issue where an error may appear when making calls to trigger an email. This occurs when the public key uploaded for the Adobe IO integration expires, and therefore needs to be replaced.

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Campaign Standard

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

The following error may appear when making calls for events in ACS to trigger an email:






```
{

   "error_description": "No valid bindings were found for organization and technical account combination",

   "error": "invalid_token"

}
```






While it was working fine before, the JSON Web Token (JWT) now is being denied access. This can occur when using Adobe IO integration.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The public key uploaded for the Adobe IO integration had expired, as can be seen in the Adobe IO integration console. Replacing the public key and updating its JWT fixed the issue.
