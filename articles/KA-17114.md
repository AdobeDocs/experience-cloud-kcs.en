# Can Page_events other than 0 (custom links) be seen as a page view?

## Description


Can customer links (page_event other than 0) be counted as a page view?


## Resolution


Yes! It is possible for custom links to be counted as a page view. The UI counts any value with a post_pagename populated as a page view.Â  If a processing rule or some other method is being used to force a post_pagename to have a value for custom link hits, then the hit will be counted as a page view in the UI. The page view will have a value of whatever is in post_pagename.
