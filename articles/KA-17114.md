# Can Page_events other than 0 (custom links) be seen as a page view?

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Customer Journey Analytics
- Analytics



<b>Issues/Symptoms</b>
Can customer links (page_event other than 0) be counted as a page view?


## Resolution


Yes! It is possible for custom links to be counted as a page view. The UI counts any value with a `post_pagename` populated as a page view. If a processing rule or some other method is being used to force a `post_pagename` to have a value for custom link hits, then the hit will be counted as a page view in the UI. The page view will have a value of whatever is in `post_pagename`.
