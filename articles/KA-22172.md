How to fetch log files for AEM Cloud Service?


## Resolution {#resolution}


It is possible to obtain these logs from within [Cloud Manager](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/using-cloud-manager/manage-logs.html?lang=en).

These logs can also be downloaded using the [Adobe I/O CLI Cloud Manager Plugin](https://github.com/adobe/aio-cli-plugin-cloudmanager), which is highly recommended by our Cloud SMEs as it allows you to tail logs and also has functions unavailable in the Web interface. Refer to the following documentation to learn [how to set up Adobe I/O Cloud Manager](https://experienceleaguecommunities.adobe.com/t5/adobe-experience-manager/setting-up-adobe-i-o-cli-for-cloud-manager-aem-community-blog/m-p/380156).
