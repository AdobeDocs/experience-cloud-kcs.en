Sorting Freeform tables in Workspace by dimension is only possible in Customer Journey Analytics, not in traditional Adobe Analytics.<br> <br>A workaround is to use static dimension items.  Sort Freeform tables by static dimension items which have been selected.<br> <br>For more information about static dimension items, please refer [Dynamic vs static dimension items in freeform tables](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/analyze/analysis-workspace/visualizations/freeform-table/column-row-settings/manual-vs-dynamic-rows.html?lang=en).
