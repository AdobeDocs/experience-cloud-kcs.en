# AEP - Adobe Experience Platform Use Case Playbooks menu is missing


[Adobe Experience Platform Use Case Playbooks](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/use-case-playbooks/playbooks/overview) menu is missing from your sandbox

## Description {#description}

I am trying to use the [Adobe Experience Platform Use Case Playbooks](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/use-case-playbooks/playbooks/overview). Despite following the process in the documentation, I am not seeing the "Playbook" link in the left hand side menu. Wondering whether we need any special permission for this?

## Resolution {#resolution}


There are 2 steps to enable this.

1. Create a Sandbox with keyworks -<b>ucp</b> in it. Something like myorg-ucp
2. Make sure your user have permissions to the Use case playbook feature
