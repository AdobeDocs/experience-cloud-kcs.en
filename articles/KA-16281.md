How to enable Adobe I/O runtime?


## Resolution


Adobe customers & partners wishing to try Adobe I/O Runtime may request a trial license. They need to fill out the [Typeform](https://adobeio.typeform.com/to/RWhT8Y) to request Adobe I/O Runtime Trial.

 Document Reference:
[https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/runtime/docs.html#!adobedocs/adobeio-runtime/master/overview/request_a_trial.md](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/runtime/docs.html#!adobedocs/adobeio-runtime/master/overview/request_a_trial.md "Click to follow link: https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/runtime/docs.html#!adobedocs/adobeio-runtime/master/overview/request_a_trial.md")

Once the form is submitted, you will get an email from Adobe (on the email address mentioned in the form) confirming the request has been received and the provisioning team will take a week or two to fulfil the request. Once the request has been provisioned, you will get an email directly.
