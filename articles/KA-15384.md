# ACS - Getting RST-360011 error when trying to open a shared resource

## Description


After integrating [!DNL Campaign] with Audience Manager initially you may experience the following error when trying to open a shared resource (visitor ID), the following error is generated:


```
RST-360011 An error has occurred - please contact your administrator.
Please make sure you have permission to Adobe Audience Library. Error while calling the network: status: 404 URL: https://dcu.experiencecloud.adobe.com/content/mac/dcu/audiences/folder?action=list_datasources&ims=1.
XTK-170006 Unable to parse expression ' GetDataSources()'.
XTK-170006 Unable to parse expression ' GetDataSources()'
```





## Resolution


The solution is to add the "Audience Library" product to the user's profile under the "Products" section. It would be recommended to set the user as a <b>product administrator</b> of the Audience Library product.
