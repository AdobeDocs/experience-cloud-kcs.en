# Disabling weak ciphers

## Description {#description}


### Environment

AEM as a cloud service

### Issue/Symptoms

Several security scans detect weak ciphers at the CDN level, such as `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`.


## Resolution {#resolution}


AEM does not use these weak ciphers at the L7 (HTTP level). The mentioned cipher `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256` is likely at L4 (TCP level) as there are a few security scan solutions that will only test at L4. We cannot block a weak cipher at L4 (TCP level). Since weak ciphers are only used by old web browser versions, blocking at the L7 level should mitigate any security concerns since those will only use HTTP/L7.


<br>Cause<br>
Some security scan software applications only check weak ciphers at the L4 level.
