# Adobe Experience Manager: Images on Remote DAM do not appear due to permission

## Description {#description}


When Images on Remote DAM do not appear in Sites instances, an error indicates that permission to access /libs/dam/remoteassets/assets/dmconfigured is required.
 This article explains how to grant the necessary permission for Connected Assets.

## Resolution {#resolution}


The connectedassets-assets-techaccts group has the necessary permission. Add Sites authors to the connectedassets-assets-techaccts group in the Sites instance to show the images.
