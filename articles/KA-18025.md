# Adobe Campaign: Delivery Outbound Transition = 0 even though deliveries are still sent and received.

## Description


<b>Issue:</b>

When sending a delivery with an outbound transition in a workflow, the delivery is set to either "Prepare" or "Prepare and Start". Once the workflow runs, the outbound transition of the delivery shows 0 on the UI. The delivery is still sent as expected everything else is working but the UI just doesn't display the correct number of recipients in the outbound transition. This is occurring for all workflows regardless of how the workflow is created.



<b>Cause:</b>

The `NmsBroadLogMsg` table is missing the record where `iBroadLogMsgId = 0` which is needed for the SQL query to populate the `temp` table used by the outbound transition.


## Resolution

Resolution:<br><br>
Please reach out to your Database Admin and have them insert a new record into the `NmsBroadLogMsg` table where the values are equal to 0.
