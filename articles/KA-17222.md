# Campaign Classic - Errors related to Legacy Trigger Implementation

## Description


By end of 18th August 2021 the [!DNL Analytics] team will activate the new way of authentication.

While the hosted customer is not impacted (required upgrade has been performed) it is possible that some hybrid or on-premise customer could be impacted (communication have been sent earlier).

When the deprecation takes place, such customers will start seeing the following error in their `pipelined.log`.

<b>`Error while authenticating: '{"error":"This client: APP_ID is no longer allowed to get access token."}' (iRc=16384)`</b>

<b>`APP_ID`</b> will have the value of the `appName(Legacy)`


## Resolution


In case of customers (on-premise or hybrid) reporting issue to connect to [!DNL Analytics]/[!DNL Triggers] after August 18:

- This mean the customer is running on an old version of [!DNL Campaign] and/or has not performed the required upgrade step as defined in 1
- Until Nov 2021 there’s a workaround available to unblock the customer by whitelisting the AppID of its OAuth application
- How to request the whitelisting?
   - Get the customer <b>AppID (appName(Legacy))</b>, details are available on the dedicated documentation page 1. You can get the `APP_ID` from Error message as well.
   - Submit the request for whitelisting by sharing the app name on the dedicated slack channel <b>`#analytics_1_3_api_eol_discussion (on adobedx.slack.com)`</b>
- The whitelisting will remain active though Nov 2021, time for customer to perform the connector upgrade steps
