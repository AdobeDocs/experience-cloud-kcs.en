# Active Profiles not showing up to date in Control Panel

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign Standard



<b>Issues/Symptoms</b>
It has been reported that active profiles are not up to date in Control Panel.

To see this, navigate to Control Panel  Performance Monitoring  Active Profiles.

Note that the Active profiles count is not up to date, the data till 14/1/2022 was showing and no data/update thereafter.


## Resolution {#resolution}


To address this, check the Billing workflow to ensure that Active contacts are updated. If there are any errors in the workflow, resolve them and restart the workflow.

Campaign continuously fetches data from the internal systems in near real-time and stores it in Control Panel to show it in the desired format. Data which has lapsed will not be displayed within Control Panel.
