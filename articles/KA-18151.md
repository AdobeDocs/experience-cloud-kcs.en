# Active Profiles not showing up to date in control panel


This article addresses the Adobe Campaign Standard issue whereÂ the count of Active profiles is not up to date. The resolution involves restarting the billing workflow if there are any errors.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Campaign Standard

### <b>Issues/Symptoms</b>

Active profiles are not up to date in the control panel.

To see this, navigate to <b>Control Panel</b> `>`  <b>Performance Monitoring</b> `>`  <b>Active Profiles</b>.

Note that the Active profiles count was not up to date. Only data till 14/1/2022 was showing and none thereafter.


## Resolution {#resolution}


To address this, check the Billing workflow to ensure that Active contacts are updated. If there are any errors in the workflow, resolve them and restart the workflow.

Campaign continuously fetches data from the internal systems in near real-time, and stores it in Control Panel to show it in the desired format. Data which has lapsed will not be displayed within Control Panel.
