# Javascript"IOB-090013 error:14090086:SSL routines:ssl3_get_server_certificate:certificate verify failed"

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Campaign Classic
- Campaign
- Campaign Classic v7




### <b>Issues/Symptoms</b>

Javascript activities within a workflow are failing with the error below after upgrading from *V9032* to *V9188*:




```
IOB-090020 Error in SSL library:'IOB-090013 error:14090086:SSL routines:ssl3_get_server_certificate:certificate verify failed (code 336134278)'
```



## Resolution {#resolution}

<b>There are 2 workarounds available for this issue:</b>
1. As a temporary workaround the customer.sh can be configured with WPP_SSL_ALLOW_INSECURE environment set to 1. Setting WPP_SSL_ALLOW_INSECURE env variable to 1 will disable this hostname check. 
2. Download the certificates locally to the campaign server so they are accessible.<br>
Engineering confirmed that a permanent fix will be available from *20.3.*



<b>Cause</b>
The issue is because the certificates are not available on the local server.
