The article describes two resolutions to resolve the error -Â *Javascript"IOB-090013 error:14090086:SSL routines:ssl3_get_server_certificate:certificate verify failed"*

## Description {#description}


### Environment

- Campaign Classic
- Campaign
- Campaign Classic v7


### Issues/Symptoms

Javascript activities within a workflow are failing with the error below after upgrading from *V9032*to *V9188*:


```
IOB-090020 Error in SSL library: 
'IOB-090013 error:14090086:SSL routines:ssl3_get_server_certificate:certificate verify failed (code 336134278)'
```



## Resolution {#resolution}


There are 2 workarounds available for this issue:

1. As a temporary workaround the customer.sh can be configured with WPP_SSL_ALLOW_INSECURE environment set to 1. Setting WPP_SSL_ALLOW_INSECURE env variable to 1 will disable this hostname check.
2. Download the certificates locally to the campaign server so they are accessible.


Engineering confirmed that a permanent fix will be available from *20.3.*

### Cause

The issue is because the certificates are not available on the local server.
