# AEM Maintenance update error


Learn how to solve the maintenance update error in AEM.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)

### Issue/Symptoms

An AEM Maintenance update error occurs, along with a maintenance job failure. This also concerns if the CM (cloud manager) retires automatically.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The CM (cloud manager) does not automatically retire.

The upgrade team monitors these types of errors, which may occur during the maintenance update, and further research is made to understand if there was a certain type of rollback.
Also, if the maintenance job fails it does not re-run again during the next scheduled maintenance run. If it continues to fail, it's recommend to find the error message in the log and understand what causes the failure.

For more details, please contact support for any kind of assistance in understanding the occurrences of these failures.
