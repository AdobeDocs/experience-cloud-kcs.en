# Blank screen when accessing proof | Workfront


If you encounter a blank white screen when accessing proof through the New Proof email notification or URL, add the user to the sharing permission list.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Workfront



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

When accessing a proof through the New Proof email notification, or by the Proof's URL, a blank white screen is encountered.


## Resolution {#resolution}

<b>Step to resolve:</b>
Often, users cannot access the proof because they are not added to the <b>Sharing permission</b> list on the <b>Document Object</b>. To fix this, follow these steps:

1. Go to the <b>Document object</b> directly in Workfront and select <b>Document Details</b>.
2. Click on <b>Share</b> to list the sharing permissions of the <b>Document object</b>. Check whether the user's name is listed.
3. If not, add the user to the sharing permissions. The user will be able to access the proof after this is done.




If the user is listed and still having problems, please contact [Customer Support](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront/using/basics/tips-tricks-for-basics/contact-customer-support.html)
