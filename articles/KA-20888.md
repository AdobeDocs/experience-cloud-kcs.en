# Fine-Grained Priorities on Recommendations Activity

## Description {#description}

If you enable Fine-Grained Priorities (0 to 999), you can set the activity priority settings from 3 levels of "high/medium/low" to 1000 levels of "0 to 999". However, recommendations activities remain at the 3-level priority of "high/medium/low" even if Fine-Grained Priorities settings are enabled.

## Resolution {#resolution}


Recommendations activities are currently unaffected by Fine-Grained Priorities settings, so even if you enable it, the Recommendations activities priority setting will be "high/medium/low."

This is because the Recommendations activities generally have a low priority, and they are often fixed and displayed in a specific location. Hence, conflicts with other activities are rare.

There are currently no plans to provide Fine-Grained Priorities to Recommendations activities.
