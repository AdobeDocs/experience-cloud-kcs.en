This article explains troubleshooting a synchronization issue between Admin Console user group changes and your AEM environment.

<b>Environment</b>
 AEM as a Cloud Service, AEM 6.5(Managed Service)


## Resolution {#resolution}


When you modify user groups in the Admin Console, these changes may not be immediately visible in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).Â The updates are synchronized when the affected user logs into AEM. To confirm the changes, log into AEM and check the user/group information.
