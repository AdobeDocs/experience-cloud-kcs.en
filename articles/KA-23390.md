# User group changes in admin console not reflected in AEM


When you modify the user groups in the Admin Console, the changes might not be immediately visible in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). To confirm the changes, log into AEM and check the user/group information.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Experience Manager as a Cloud Service


- Experience Manager 6.5




### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Modification of user groups in the admin console is not reflected in the Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).


## Resolution {#resolution}


When you make changes to user groups in the Admin Console, it may take some time for the updates to take effect in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). To ensure that the changes have been synchronized, the affected user needs to log in to AEM. Once they have done so, you can verify the changes by checking the user/group information in AEM.
