# Convert a JAR file into an OSGi bundle


To convert a Java Archive (JAR) file into an OSGi bundle, follow the steps to create an OSGi bundle from the attached junit-4.4.jar, as described in this article below.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Experience Manager

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

How do I convert an existing Java Archive (JAR) file into an Open Service Gateway Initiative (OSGi) bundle?


## Resolution {#resolution}


1. Start by creating a JAR's manifest file:
    


    ```
    Manifest-Version: 1.0
    Created-By: myself
    Bundle-ManifestVersion: 2
    Bundle-Name: JUnit 4.4 bundle
    Bundle-Description: Package junit 4.4 in an OSGi bundle
    Bundle-Version: 4.4.0
    Bundle-ClassPath: .,junit-4.4.jar
    Bundle-SymbolicName: org.junit.framework
    Export-Package: junit.framework,junit.extensions,org.junit.runner,org.junit,junit.textui
    ```



    



    - `Bundle-ClassPath` header is set to allow embedding the original jar as is. Make sure its value matches the filename of the jar that you are going to embed in the bundle.
    - `Export-Package` is a list of packages contained in the jar that you would like to make available to other bundles running in the OSGi Container.
2. JAR file<br>    


    Get the [jar](http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/maven2/junit/junit/4.4/junit-4.4.jar) file.
3. Create the bundle jar file by running the following command:<br>    


    ```
    jar cvfm junit-4.4-bundle.jar manifest.txt junit-4.4.jar
    ```



    Where `manifest.txt` is the name of the manifest file created above.


That's it - the resulting jar file is an OSGi bundle the exports the packages listed in `Export-Package` above, using the classes of the embedded `junit-4.4.jar.`
