# How to Convert a jar File into an OSGi Bundle

## Description {#description}


How do I convert an existing jar file into an OSGi bundle?


## Resolution {#resolution}


Here's a very simple way of turning an existing jar file in an OSGi bundle, while keeping control on exported packages.

The example creates an OSGi bundle from the attached junit-4.4.jar.

<b>Note:</b> The method below only works in a scenario where the jar file has no dependencies on other external jar files.



1. Start by creating a the jar's manifest file:

    ```
    Manifest-Version: 1.0
    Created-By: myself
    Bundle-ManifestVersion: 2
    Bundle-Name: JUnit 4.4 bundle
    Bundle-Description: Package junit 4.4 in an OSGi bundle
    Bundle-Version: 4.4.0
    Bundle-ClassPath: .,junit-4.4.jar
    Bundle-SymbolicName: org.junit.framework
    Export-Package: junit.framework,junit.extensions,org.junit.runner,org.junit,junit.textui
    ```

    - `Bundle-ClassPath` header is set to allow embedding the original jar as is. Make sure its value matches the filename of the jar that you are going to embed in the bundle.
    - `Export-Package` is a list of packages contained in the jar that you would like to make available to other bundles running in the OSGi Container.
2. Get the [jar](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/junit/junit/4.4/junit-4.4.jar) file.
3. Create the bundle jar file by running the following command:


    ```
    jar cvfm junit-4.4-bundle.jar manifest.txt junit-4.4.jar
    ```



    Where `manifest.txt` is the name of the manifest file created above.

    

    That's it - the resulting jar file is an OSGi bundle the exports the packages listed in `Export-Package` above, using the classes of the embedded junit-4.4.jar.
