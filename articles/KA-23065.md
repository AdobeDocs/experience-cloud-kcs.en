# Tasks cannot be created in Assets Essentials


Environment: AEM as a Cloud Service

## Description {#description}


When using the Assets Essentials UI, also called Workspace, for a specific asset repository, tasks cannot be created.
 When filling the task and clicking "save" the error "*Unable to create task*" appears. 
 Additionally, the browser's developer console displays the following error:

*Access to fetch at 'https://author-pxxxxxx-eyyyyyy.adobeaemcloud.com/adobe/collab/tasks/id/urn:aaid:aem:4c0a5fe9-1020-42dd-b737-b7b5c7909760' from origin 'https://exc-unifiedcontent.experience.adobe.net' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.

## Resolution {#resolution}


Checking the logs, it could be seen that the request to create the task was rejected by the ReferrerFilter - `[` 1`]`

Further on, upon verifying the Apache Sling Referrer Filter OSGi configuration, it could be seen that on the instance where the task could not be created, there was nothing defined for the "Allow Regexp Host."
However, the allow regexp host should have the values `[` 2`]`  defined.

Adding the missing values to the "Allow Regexp Host" property of the Apache Sling Referrer Filter OSGi configuration fixed the problem.
