# Campaign Standard: Unsubscriptions report does not display the count of recipients that have opted out


This article addresses the issue in Adobe Campaign Standard where the unsubscriptions report doesn't show the count of the opted-out recipients. To resolve this, you need to modify the default (OOTB) Unsubscription link type to "optout".

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Campaign Standard

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

The Unsubscriptions report showsÂ *0* (zero) for the deliveries.

However, when checking some of the deliveries, their tracking log journals show the unsubscribe events.


## Resolution {#resolution}


For reference, this is the default (OOTB) Unsubscription link in ACS:


```
<a href="<%@ value object="branding" xpath="@serverUrl" %> /lp/bl?pkey= <%= escapeUrl(context.profile.PKey)%> "_label="Opt-out link" _type="optout">click here</a>
```


By modifying the link type to be "optout", the Unsubsciptions report will display the metric correctly.

### Cause

The problem is that the <b>Unsubscribe</b> links from the email content are recorded as an "email click" by the tracking log.
