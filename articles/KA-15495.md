# ACS: Unsubscriptions report doesn't show opted-out recipients count

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Campaign Standard

<b>Issue</b>
 Unsubscriptions report shows as *0* (zero) for the deliveries.

However, by checking some of the deliveries, their tracking log journals show the unsubscribe events.

<b>Cause</b>
 The problem is that the <b>Unsubscribe</b> links from the email content are recorded as an "email click" by the tracking log.


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>

For reference, this is the default (OOTB) Unsubscription link in ACS:


```
a href="%@ value object="branding" xpath="@serverUrl" %/lp/bl?pkey=%= escapeUrl(context.profile.PKey)%" _label="Opt-out link" _type="optout"click here/a
```


By modifying the link type to be "optout",  the Unsubsciptions report will display the metric correctly.
