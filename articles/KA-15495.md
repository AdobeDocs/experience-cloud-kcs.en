# Campaign Standard: The [!UICONTROL Unsubscriptions] report does not display the count of recipients that have opted out

## Description


It has been reported that the [!UICONTROL Unsubscriptions] report was showing as 0 for the deliveries. However, by checking some of the deliveries, their tracking log journals are showing the unsubscribe events.


## Resolution


The problem is that the "Unsubscribe" links from the email content are recorded as an "Email click" by the tracking log.

For reference, here's the default (OOTB) Unsubscription link in ACS:

```
a href="%@valueobject="branding" xpath="@serverUrl" %/lp/bl?pkey=%= escapeUrl(context.profile.PKey)%"_label="Opt-out link" _type="optout"click here/a
```

By modifying the link type to be "optout",  the [!UICONTROL Unsubsciptions] report will display the metric correctly.
