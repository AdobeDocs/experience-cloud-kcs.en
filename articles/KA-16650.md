# Adobe Campaign Standard: Can a collection within a collection be used within a JSON payload

## Description

It has been asked if it's possible for ACS to accept a JSON payload with a collection within a collection.

## Resolution

Currently this is not supported with ACS however CAMP-47184 has been opened as an enhancement with R&D to have this functionality reviewed for a future release.
