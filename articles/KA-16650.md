# Can a collection within a collection be used within a JSON payload

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
Campaign Standard
<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
Is it possible for Adobe Campaign Standard (ACS) to accept a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) payload with a collection within a collection?


## Resolution {#resolution}


Currently, this is not supported with Adobe Campaign Standard (ACS). However, <b>CAMP-47184</b> has been opened as an enhancement with R&D to have this functionality reviewed for a future release.
