# Unable to delete the Workflow after error

## Description


It has been reported that in Adobe Campaign standard, after an error was hit, the workflow itself could not be deleted. Even after modifying and re-saving the workflow the following error gets thrown when attempting to delete the workflow.

<b>Error</b>:

ST-360011 An error has occurred - please contact your administrator.

RST-360011 An error has occurred - please contact your administrator.

XTK-170017 The expression definition exceeds the number of authorized recursions.

## Resolution


What is preventing the delete from occurring is that the application is still attempting to write logs to the workflow. This process can get stuck and to fix the issue, the workflow logs need to be purged. This kills the backend job and allows the workflow to be deleted.



To purge the workflow history see the online documentation:
