## Resolution {#resolution}


at.js itself is asynchronous.

Once you load the script onto the page (which is what Launch is doing sync) the rest of Target is async. Target (at.js) is bundled with the launch library. So the "at.js" will be delivered to the page sync if Launch is synced.

However, all the calls that the at.js makes are async calls to the Target server. So, there are no other steps you need to take specifically in Launch to load target libraries asynchronously.
