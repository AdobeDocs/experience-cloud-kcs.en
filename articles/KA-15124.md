# Target - Load at.js async while launch is loaded synchronously

## Description


Can anybody share your thoughts around how to load Adobe Target async while the launch is loaded synchronously?

We had this option in DTM by using a checkbox.


## Resolution


at.js itself is asynchronous. Once you load the script onto the page (which is what Launch is doing sync) the rest of Target is async. Target (at.js) is bundled with the launch library. So the "at.js" will be delivered to the page sync if Launch is sync.

However, all the calls that the at.js makes are async calls to Target server. So thereÂ  is no other steps you need to take specifically in Launch to load target libraries asynchronously.
