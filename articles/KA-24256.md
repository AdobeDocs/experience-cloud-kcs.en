# Adobe Experience Manager: How to unset the existing thumbnail from a page


This article introduces a method to revert the thumbnail setting back to the default.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service
- Adobe Experience Manager 6.5


### Issue/Symptoms

Although it is possible to change a thumbnail that has been set on a page, there is no direct option to reset it to the default.


## Resolution {#resolution}


To resolve this issue, delete the /jcr:content/image node located under the page path. For instance, if you delete the /content/wknd/jcr:content/image node in CRXDE Lite, the thumbnail for the homepage of the WKND Site will revert to the default.
