# Adobe Experience Manager: How to unset the existing thumbnail from a page

## Description {#description}

Although it is possible to change a thumbnail that has been set on a page, there is no direct option to reset it to the default. This article introduces a method to revert the thumbnail setting back to the default.<br>
<b>Environments</b>

AEM as a Cloud Service, AEM 6.5


## Resolution {#resolution}


Delete the /jcr:content/image node located under the page path. For instance, if you delete the /content/wknd/jcr:content/image node in CRXDE Lite, the thumbnail for the homepage of the WKND Site will revert to the default.
