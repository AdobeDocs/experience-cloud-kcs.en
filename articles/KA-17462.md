<b>Duration of Lock</b>

The system automatically unlocks the account after one hour if you do not attempt to login between this period. To unlock your account, please click on the link "Forget your password" on the SPS login screen. The system will immediately unlock your account, and send an email with the new temporary password. You can use this password to login to the system.
