## Resolution

<br>SSO is enabled by default for all integrations, however, it is configured so that SSO is disabled.<br><br>To confirm if SSO is disabled, you can review the integration in the TVE Dashboard.<br><br>Following attributes are set to YES, if SSO has been disabled for a Channel - MVPD integration:<br><br>
1. Auth / Aggregator        --    YES
2. Enable Passive AuthN --    YES

If the settings are not set or set to NO, SSO is available for the integration. Changing these settings to NO also allow you to enable SSO.<br><br>You can find these settings by going to your specific integration (Make sure that Advanced workspace is selected).<br><br>Click your specific integration in TVE Dashboard.
- Select the General Settings Tab and scroll down.
