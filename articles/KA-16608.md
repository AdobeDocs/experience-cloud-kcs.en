1. Auth / Aggregator        --    YES
2. Enable Passive AuthN --    YES

If the settings are not set or set to NO, SSO is available for the integration. Changing these settings to NO also allow you to enable SSO.<br><br>You can find these settings by going to your specific integration (Make sure that Advanced workspace is selected).
