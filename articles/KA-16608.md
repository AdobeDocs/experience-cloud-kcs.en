How can I confirm if the Single Sign-On (SSO) is enabled or disabled for my Channel?


## Resolution {#resolution}


Single Sign-On (SSO) is enabled by default for all integrations, however, it can be configured so that SSO is disabled.

To confirm if SSO is disabled, you can review the integration in the TVE Dashboard.

Following attributes are set to YES, if SSO has been disabled for a Channel - Multichannel Video Programming Distributor (MVPD) integration:

1. <b>Auth / Aggregator        --`>`     YES</b>
2. <b>Enable Passive AuthN   --`>`     YES</b>


If the settings are not set or set to NO, SSO is available for the integration. Changing these settings to NO also allow you to enable SSO.

You can find these settings by going to your specific integration (Make sure that Advanced workspace is selected).

1. Click your specific integration in TVE Dashboard.![](assets/6664dc8b-ff71-eb11-a812-00224809a536.png)
