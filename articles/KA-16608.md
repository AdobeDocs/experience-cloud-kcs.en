How can I confirm if the Single Sign-On (SSO) is enabled or disabled for my Channel?


## Resolution

Single Sign-On (SSO) is enabled by default for all integrations, however, it can be configured so that SSO is disabled.<br>To confirm if SSO is disabled, you can review the integration in the TVE Dashboard.<br>Following attributes are set to YES, if SSO has been disabled for a Channel - Multichannel Video Programming Distributor (MVPD) integration:<br>
1. Auth / Aggregator        --    YES
2. Enable Passive AuthN   --    YES

If the settings are not set or set to NO, SSO is available for the integration. Changing these settings to NO also allow you to enable SSO.<br>You can find these settings by going to your specific integration (Make sure that Advanced workspace is selected).
1. Click your specific integration in TVE Dashboard.![](assets/6664dc8b-ff71-eb11-a812-00224809a536.png)
