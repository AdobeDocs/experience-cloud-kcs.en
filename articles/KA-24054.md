# Tracking workflow fails with broadlogRcp and Oracle error


Correct these target mappings to use a tracking log schema for the schema where tracking logs are stored and save the modification.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Classic v7 (ACC v7)

### Issue

The <b>tracking workflow</b> fails with the following errors:


```
Attribute 'broadLog-id' unknown (see definition of schema 'Delivery recipient logs (nms:broadLogRcp)').

ORA-210000 Oracle Error: ORA-00904: "ITRACKINGLOGID": invalid identifier
```


### Cause

One or more target mappings use the schema `nms:broadLogRcp` as the tracking log schema `storage/@trackingLogSchema`Â in their definition.

This is incorrect, making the tracking workflow fail.

### Steps to reproduce

1. The tracking workflow is in a paused state.
2. When checking the audit logs of the workflow, the following errors are displayed:

    


    ```
    Attribute 'broadLog-id' unknown (see definition of schema 'Recipient delivery log (nms:broadLogRcp)').
    ORA-210000 Oracle Error: ORA-00904: "ITRACKINGLOGID": invalid identifier
    ```



## Resolution {#resolution}


1. Display all the target mappings defined on the instance.
2. Add the column `storage/@trackingLogSchema`, and check which of the target mappings use `nms:broadLogRcp` as the tracking log schema `storage/@trackingLogSchema`.
3. Correct these target mappings to use a tracking log schema (Example: `nms:trackingLogRcp` schema) for the schema where tracking logs are stored, and <b>save</b> the modification.
4. Restart the tracking log workflow.
