# Adobe Campaign Standard: Does ACS have a global option in the app to turn on/off BCC Archiving?

## Description


It has been asked whether or not it's possible to turn BCC Archiving on or off at the institution level versus at the individual delivery level.


## Resolution


Currently this functionality does not exist, but enhancement CAMP-45943 has been submitted for this to be added in a future release.
