# Troubleshooting SAML related issues in AEM

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
Experience Manager


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
How can we troubleshoot Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) related issues with Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)?


## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Infinite loop Issue:</b>

- Check if ds:signature is part of SAML assertion  If not, this is to be done on IDP end and check the checkbox for signed Assertion
- Check for nameId format in SAML response, the format should exactly match the nameId Policy format as configured in SAML Config
- Check for SAML AudienceRestriction in SAML response, the value of this tag should exactly match the entity ID in SAML config
- Check for saml2: conditions (NotBefore & NotOnOrAfter), Server is not in sync with ntp server. Use ntpd and force it to sync sys time (ntpdate -s pool.ntp.org). For test, change the clock tolerance to -1, this will ignore clock difference.
- Check if idp do not have assertion signed. Ask idp team that response is signed, and the assertion needs to be signed as per saml spec.
- Check if SAML tracer output if the assertion from IDP is encrypted. If yes, Config of SAML auth handler should use the encryption checkbox


<b>Check if SAML Certificate is in proper format:</b>

- Fetch the signature from SAML response and correct the certificate i.e., after 65th line, press enter and so on.
- This can be then used to install in AEM truststore and match certificate details with IDP.


<b>Encryption:</b>

- First always complete SAML setup without encryption. When this is done then enable encryption. Using this way, it is easy to debug the issue


<b>Dispatcher:</b>

- Make sure SAML login request is allowed in the filters section.If not, Update the /filter section to allow POST requests to \*/saml_login.

    

    /0100 { /type "allow" /method "POST" /url "\*/saml_login" }


- Check for change in Mod header(mod_header) on web server level in httpd.conf.It should be in below format

     Header always edit Set-Cookie (.\*) "$1; HTTPOnly; Secure"


<b>Invalid Assertion:</b>
<br> <br> <br>

| 1<br>2 | `com.adobe.granite.auth.saml.model.Assertion Invalid Assertion: Signature invalid.``com.adobe.granite.auth.saml.SamlAuthenticationHandler Private key of SP not provided: Cannot sign Authn request` |
| --- | --- |


- Issue could be with certificate stored in the truststore. Solution here could be to delete and re-upload the new idp_cert and check the use-case.
- If you are not encypting the SAML response, you can ignore "Private key of SP not provided: Cannot sign Authn request" error.


<b>Cannot Retrieve Private Key:</b>
<br> <br> <br>

| 1<br>2 | `com.adobe.granite.security.user.internal.servlets.KeyStoreManagingServlet,1121, javax.servlet.Servlet ServiceEvent REGISTERED``saml.log:27.01.2019 14:16:13.642 *ERROR* qtp275633701-179 com.adobe.granite.auth.saml.SamlAuthenticationHandler KeyStore uninitialized. Cannot retrieve private key to decrypt assertions.` |
| --- | --- |

 
- This error means, IDP has encrypted the assertionand there is no private key to decrypt the response. If you want to encrypt the response, you need to upload a valid private key in the AEM keystore.

<br> 
<b>Information to provide when raising a SAML related Support ticket:</b>

- SAML Request
- SAML Response
- SAML configuration
- DEBUG logs for SAML (com.adobe.granite.auth.saml)
- Error.log
- HAR1 file to extract SAML Request/Response
