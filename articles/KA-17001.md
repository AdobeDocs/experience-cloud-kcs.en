# ECID not persisting after upgrading to AEP SDK

## Description


The Experience Cloud ID (ECID) is preserved during app upgrades, relaunch, and between sessions. What could be one of the reasons for the ECID not persisting?


## Resolution


The ECID doesn't persist across the upgrades or sessions when both the SDKs - 4.x SDK and AEP SDK - coexist in the app at the same time.Â  After the dependency to the old SDK is completely removed, the ECID migration will take place and the value will persist, as expected.
