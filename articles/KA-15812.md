# Enrichment/Query activity: All Rows option gives error

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Campaign Classic

<b>Issue</b>
 Using the <b>All Rows</b> option with Enrichment or Query activity results in an error:


```
BAS-010000 Unable to complete the operation in current status.
```



## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>
The <b>All Rows</b> option is working normally after clicking on <b>Finish</b> (instead of <b>Next</b>) and then running the workflow.

There seems to be a minor issue with the UI, and the <b>Next</b> button should be disabled after changing to the <b>All Rows</b> option.
