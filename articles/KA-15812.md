# Enrichment/Query activity: All Rows option gives error


Learn how to solve the Adobe Campaign Classic issue where the All Rows option is working normally after clicking on Finish (instead of Next) and then running the workflow.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Campaign Classic

### Issue/Symptoms

Using the All Rows option with Enrichment or Query activity results in an error: `BAS-010000 Unable to complete the operation in current status.`


## Resolution {#resolution}


The <b>All Rows</b> option is working normally after clicking on <b>Finish</b> (instead of <b>Next</b>) and then running the workflow.

There seems to be a minor issue with the UI, and the <b>Next</b> button should be disabled after changing to the <b>All Rows</b> option.
