# In-app messages not displayed


Learn how to resolve the issue where in-app messages are not displayed, even though they are sent successfully.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

- Adobe Campaign Classic v7
- Adobe Campaign Standard




### Issue/Symptoms

In-app messages are not displayed even though they are configured correctly.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Correct the `PipelineConnector` configuration and add the correct Pipeline endpoint.

`PipelineConnector` is defined in the instance config XML file:




```
"pipelineInappConnector":

{               "@pipelineEndpoint": "[ https://xxxxxxxxxx|https://api-primary-or2.prd.pipeline.adobedc.net/] ", /// "@routingLocations": "<location of endpoint"}

"
```




<b>NOTE</b>: After updating the config file to reflect the change correctly, a restart is required for the changes to take effect:

`nlserver restart pipelined@instance{{}} *`



### Cause

The Pipeline configuration for `PipelineConnector` is wrong and pointing to the wrong Pipeline endpoint.
