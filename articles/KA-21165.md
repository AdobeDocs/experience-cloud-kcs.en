# "Messages queued (dynamic flow control)" encountered during email delivery


Learn the cause and ways to resolve the issue where you get the "*Messages queued (dynamic flow control)*" error message during email delivery.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Campaign
- Campaign Classic




### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

You have collated the error messages for the most common domains that are having deliverability issues with your emails. The most volume is associated with the following error: *Messages queued (dynamic flow control)*.


## Resolution {#resolution}


1. *Dynamic flow control* errors occur when the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) has too many errors in a domain in a brief period. The MTA is coded to enter this *backoff* mode to prevent a blocking/throttling event in a domain from worsening, which could very well happen if it doesn't slow down or stop sending temporarily.

    
2. And to be clear, the term *errors* could mean any failed attempt to connect or deliver to a domain. It could be an internal MTA error, not just a (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) SMTP bounce or a connection attempt refusal from the domain. So, this needs to be investigated to make sure that the issues aren't with the MTA itself. 

    
3. Assume the *Dynamic flow control* errors are occurring in just a few domains. In that case, it's more likely that it's due to Deliverability reputation and that they're being blocked/throttled by those domains. And if it's a Deliverability reputation issue, you will need the Deliverability hours to investigate the cause and determine a strategy to fix things.
