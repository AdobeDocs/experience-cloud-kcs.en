# How to ready a cookie Value in a Profile Script

## Description


Trying to create a profile script where we check for the existence of a cookie before returning "true"/"false", haveÂ tried using the user.cookie syntax but it doesn't seem to be working.
 Is this method actually possible via a profile script?


## Resolution


That there is a way to achieve this through Profile Scripts as profile scripts are server side and cookies are client side.

This can be achieved through mboxParameters.
