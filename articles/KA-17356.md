# How can we secure [!DNL Target] cookies?

## Description

Currently [!DNL target] cookies are not with secure flag. How can we ensure that cookies are secure?<br><br><br>

## Resolution


Target cookies on the website does not store user credentials or [!DNL target] account information, so we believe user impersonation or compromise of [!DNL target] account is not at risk. [!DNL Target] cookies just store the visitor information on the page to be able to display [!DNL target] activities and store website visitor profile to [!DNL Target] servers.
 
Adobe do annual security pen tests on our products via [!DNL thirdparty] and we are not aware of any open vulnerabilities/exploits related to our cookies.  If you wishes to do security testing, your security team certainly can and share the vulnerabilities found, if any.
