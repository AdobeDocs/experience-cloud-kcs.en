<b>Steps to reproduce:</b>

1. In Adobe Campaign Classic, create and send deliveries.
2. After the analysis and preparation phases are completed, deliveries are stuck in the *Pending* status and not sent to the recipient.
3. The same events are sent successfully when using a different sender domain.
