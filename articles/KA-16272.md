## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Resolution/Workaround</b>

Increase the Javascript maxMB parameter: https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/installing-campaign-classic/appendices/the-server-configuration-file.html?lang=en#javascript

<b>Cause</b>

The default maxMB parameter setting is 512. This sets the maximum size in megabytes allowed before running the garbage collector. Occasionally this setting is insufficient, causing script errors which can be corrected by increasing the memory allotment.
