# Access Rights for Language Copy creation

## Description


While restricting the access rights the following situation may be encountered:
 Authors want to use the Language Copy functionality but when assigned to the default content-authors AEM group that functionality isn't visible.

To create a Language Copy, content-authors need permissions at /content/projects location 1. If one requires the authors to manage projects as well, then the workaround is to add the author to project-administrators group.

If a content-author user is added to the project-administrators group the option "Language Copy" is present under the "Create" button. However, it is selected the following error is displayed:


<br><br>Failed executing script /libs/cq/Page/Page.jsp: java.lang.NullPointerException<br><br>
Cannot serve request to /mnt/overlay/wcm/core/content/sites/createlanguagecopywizard.html in BundledScriptServlet (/libs/cq/gui/components/siteadmin/admin/translation/datasources/cloudconfigurations/cloudconfigurations.jsp)

This functionality is working for an user with the global administrator right (AEM-adminstrator group from the adminconsole)

## Resolution


The configuration for MSM is located under "/conf/global" and none of the two groups - content-authors and project-administrators - have permissions for the specified path.

Therefore, adding the permission "<b>/conf/global - jcr:all</b>" to the content-auhors group enables the user to successfully create Language Copies.
