# Experience Manager - Web Tier pipeline execution failing during TestCacheInvalidation

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
 Experience Manager as a Cloud Service

<b>Issue</b>
 The Web Tier pipeline execution fails with error below in log file:

=== RUN TestCacheInvalidation
 main_test.go:237: Test fails. Expected header 'X-Vhost' to be existing and not: 'catch-all', got: 'catch-all'
 --- FAIL: TestCacheInvalidation (0.00s)
 FAIL
 exit status 1


## Resolution {#resolution}

<b>Steps to Resolve</b>

- Confirm that your dispatcher configuration includes a vhost for dispatcher cache invalidation (call being done to host 127.0.0.1 or localhost - both should work), e.g., as in [https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype/blob/master/src/main/archetype/dispatcher.cloud/src/conf.d/available_vhosts/default.vhost#L24](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype/blob/master/src/main/archetype/dispatcher.cloud/src/conf.d/available_vhosts/default.vhost#L24)
- If you have an X-Vhost header, make sure that it is not empty and that the request does not reach catch-all vhost with the X-Vhost header set to "*catch-all*", as in [https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype/blob/master/src/main/archetype/dispatcher.cloud/src/conf.d/dispatcher_vhost.conf#L136](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype/blob/master/src/main/archetype/dispatcher.cloud/src/conf.d/dispatcher_vhost.conf#L167-L197)

> **Important**  
> At least one enabled vhost must declare a `ServerAlias` value that includes either `*` OR `127.0.0.1 localhost`. Including just `127.0.0.1` or just `localhost` in the `ServerAlias` is not guaranteed to handle cache invalidation requests in all versions of the dispatcher validator.
