## Resolution {#resolution}

Resolution<br><br>
- Confirm that your dispatcher configuration includes a vhost for dispatcher cache invalidation (call being done to host 127.0.0.1) e.g., as in [https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype/blob/master/src/main/archetype/dispatcher.cloud/src/conf.d/available_vhosts/default.vhost#L24](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype/blob/master/src/main/archetype/dispatcher.cloud/src/conf.d/available_vhosts/default.vhost#L24)
- If you have an X-Vhost header, make sure that it is not empty and that the request does not reach catch-al vhost with the X-Vhost header set to "catch-all" as in [https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype/blob/master/src/main/archetype/dispatcher.cloud/src/conf.d/dispatcher_vhost.conf#L136](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype/blob/master/src/main/archetype/dispatcher.cloud/src/conf.d/dispatcher_vhost.conf#L136)
