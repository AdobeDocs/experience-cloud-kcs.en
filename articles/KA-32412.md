# Adobe Campaign Standard Does Campaign use the new Litmus API?

## Description

It has been reported in ACS that the Litmus preview renders slowly.Â  It was found that ACS has been using the old preview API which is not as efficient as the latest API.

## Resolution

Currently there isn't a way around this other than to pull the recipients out of quarantine and attempt to resend a delivery.

NEO-23161 has been opened and being investigated by Adobe R&D for a permanent fix in a future release.
