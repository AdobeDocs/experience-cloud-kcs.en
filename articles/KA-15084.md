# Is it possible to share access to existing Adobe SFTP folders with another user?

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign Classic
- Campaign
- Campaign Classic v7





<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>


A customer wants to share a different *SFTP Account* and Folder within the *Adobe SFTP.*

 Can a sub-folder be created and access provided to a new User? Or could they have one additional access to their existing Adobe-hosted SFTP folders?




## Resolution


A separate *SFTP account* cannot be created and that is why this is not applicable. Therefore, the creation of a sub-folder is not possible.

We can provide additional alias accounts, that is, other usernames and passwords that actually point to the same real account (same directory and same permissions).
