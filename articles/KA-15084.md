# Sharing access to existing Adobe SFTP folders with another user

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Campaign Classic
- Campaign
- Campaign Classic v7


### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

You want to share a different *SFTP Account* and Folder within the *Adobe SFTP.*

 Can a sub-folder be created and access provided to a new user? Or could they have one additional access to their existing Adobe-hosted SFTP folders?


## Resolution {#resolution}


A separate *SFTP account* cannot be created and that is why this is not applicable. Therefore, the creation of a sub-folder is not possible.

We can provide additional alias accounts, that is, other usernames and passwords that actually point to the same real account (same directory and same permissions).
