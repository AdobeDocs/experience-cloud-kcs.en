# Adobe Campaign Standard: Can I add an audience using a dynamic condition?

## Description

It has been asked if it's possible to use a dynamic condition within a delivery to pull in an audience.

## Resolution

Currently the permanent fix is being investigated by R&D in NEO-20754.Â  That said, the workaround for this issue is to update the javascript code within the workflow to utilize "Math.abs()".

Old code : vars.tableName = NL.SQL.getWorkTableName("wkf", instance.id) + "_" + task.taskIdentifier + "_" + list.listId;

New code : vars.tableName = NL.SQL.getWorkTableName("wkf", Math.abs(instance.id)) + "_" + Math.abs(task.taskIdentifier) + "_" + Math.abs(list.listId);
