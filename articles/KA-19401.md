# Unwanted automatic redirection to HTTPS

## Description {#description}


### Environment

- Campaign Classic
- Campaign Classic v7
- Campaign v8


### Issues/Symptoms

When using links (mirror pages, landing pages) that appear in http linked to a particular subdomain, you are redirected towards the https version of the link by the browser.

It happens due to a parameter called *HSTS Preloading*, set at the subdomain creation, and inherently linked to the parent domain. This is hard to remove, and we cannot do it either, because we do not own the domain.
