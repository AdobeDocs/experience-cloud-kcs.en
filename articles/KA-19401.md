# Unwated automatic redirection to HTTPS

## Description

When using links (mirror pages, landing pages) that appears in http linked to a particular subdomain, the users were redirected towards the https version of the link automatically by the browser.

## Resolution


This is a parameter called "HSTS Preloading", set at the subdomain creation, and inherently linked to the parent domain. This is hard to remove and cannot be done on our side, as we do not own domain hosting.
