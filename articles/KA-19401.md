# Unwated automatic redirection to HTTPS

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign Classic
- Campaign Classic v7
- Campaign v8

<br> <br><b>Issues/Symptoms</b><br>When using links (mirror pages, landing pages) that appears in http linked to a particular subdomain, the users were redirected towards the https version of the link automatically by the browser.

## Resolution {#resolution}


This happens due to a parameter called "HSTS Preloading", set at the subdomain creation, and inherently linked to the parent domain. This is hard to remove and we cannot do it either, because we do not own the domain.
