# Image oversizing with Smart Imaging on Dynamic Media | AEM


In Adobe Experience Manager, when using Smart Imaging on Dynamic Media, image size can sometimes be larger than expected. Apply the Device Pixel Ratio optimization feature to resolve this issue.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager

### <b>Issues/Symptoms</b>

When using Smart Imaging on Dynamic Media, image size can sometimes be larger than expected.


## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Smart Imaging</b> has the*Device Pixel Ratio (DPR)* feature that dynamically adjusts image size to fit high-resolution devices, such as those with Retina displays like iPhones and iPads.

When the image size on the page doesn't match your expectations, append the `https://<b></b>?dpr=of` option to the URL parameter to verify the size. If the displayed size matches the original after applying this option, it confirms that the <b>DPR</b> feature had an effect.

Go throughÂ [Smart Imaging/About Device Pixel Ratio (DPR) optimization](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/assets/dynamic/imaging-faq.html#dpr)for a better understanding of Device Pixel Ratio optimization.

Example:

- Target image: 816 x 500
- Device Pixel Ratio: 2 (Devices such as iPhone, iPad)
- Actual delivered size: 1632 x 1000
