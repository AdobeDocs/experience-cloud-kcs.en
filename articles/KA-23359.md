# Adobe Experience Manager: Image oversizing with Smart Imaging on Dynamic Media

## Description {#description}


When using Smart Imaging on Dynamic Media, image size can sometimes be larger than expected.
 This article describes a feature that relates to this behavior.

<b>Environment</b>
 AEM as a Cloud Service, AEM 6.5, Dynamic Media


## Resolution {#resolution}


Smart Imaging has the Device Pixel Ratio (DPR) feature that dynamically adjusts image sizes to fit high-resolution devices, such as those with Retina displays like iPhones and iPads.

When the image size on the page doesn't match your expectations, append the "https://\*\*\*\*?dpr=off" option to the URL parameter to verify the size. If the displayed size matches the original after applying this option, it confirms that the DPR function had an effect.

  Device Pixel Ratio: 2 (Devices such as iPhone, iPad)
  Actual delivered size: 1632 x 1000
