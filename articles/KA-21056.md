## Resolution {#resolution}


You can remove Audience Manager completely by removing its association from these places:

- Removing DIL code
- Removing Server-Side Forwarding in Adobe Analytics Library
- Unpublishing all Analytics Segments
- Stopping Import/Export workflows in Adobe Campaign
- Stopping Adobe Target calls
- Stopping DCM log Ingestion, 3rd Party pixel calls
- Stopping all your destinations sharing data with any 2nd or 3rd party
- Stopping all offline data ingestions




<b>Removing DIL code</b>

1. In your code, identify the following functions and remove them:

    1. DIL.create
    2. DILinstance.api.signals().submit()
    3. DIL.modules.siteCatalyst.init `[` If you are forwarding data to Adobe Analytics`]`
    4. GA.submitUniversalAnalytics(); OR GA.submitUniversalAnalytics();  `[` If you are forwarding data to Google Analytics`]`
2. Once you have removed the above function, ensure that you have removed the DIL JS library from your code as well.


<b>Outcome</b>: Republish and reload your website, you should NOT see any call as https://subdomain.demdex.net/event?....



<b>Removing Server-Side Forwarding</b>

1. Go into the Analytics report suites which are enabled for Server-Side Forwarding and disable the check box.

<b>Outcome</b>: Analytics call response should be empty.

<b>Unpublishing all Analytics Segments</b>
Go into individual Analytics segments which are published and unpublish them.
<b>Outcome</b>: Offline segment share will stop from Analytics to Audience Manager.

<b>Stopping Import/Export workflows in Adobe Campaign</b>
From Audience Manager: Delete all your Campaign destinations
From Campaign: Either delete or stop completely, import/export workflows from Campaign UI.
<b>Outcome</b>: Segments to-n-fro from Audience to Campaign will be stopped.

<b>Stopping Adobe Target calls</b>
Get in touch with your Adobe Account Team, to have the “Shared Audiences” or “People Core Services” feature disabled by the Provisioning team.
<b>Outcome</b>: Target will not make additional calls to the Audience Manager.

<b>Stopping DCM log Ingestion, 3rd Party pixel calls</b>
If you have DCM log ingestion enabled, then please have it stopped and do not upload any additional metadata files.
If you have any impression/click/conversions pixel active anywhere, then please have them stopped too.
<b>Outcome</b>: No 3rd party data collection.

<b>Stopping all your destinations sharing data with any 2nd or 3rd party</b>
URL and Cookie destinations can be stopped directly from UI.
For S2S destinations, you can reach out to support to stop the destinations completely.
<b>Outcome</b>: No data will be shared out of the Audience Manager.

<b>Stopping all offline data ingestions</b>
If you are uploading any data files into Audience Manager, then please stop them right away.
<b>Outcome</b>: No offline data will be uploaded.
