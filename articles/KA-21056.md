    3. DIL.modules.siteCatalyst.init `[` If you are forwarding data to Adobe Analytics`]`
    4. GA.submitUniversalAnalytics(); OR GA.submitUniversalAnalytics();  `[` If you are forwarding data to Google Analytics`]`
2. Once you have removed above function, ensure that you have removed DIL JS library from your code as well.
