7. Stop all your destinations sharing data with any 2nd or 3rd party
8. Stop all offline data ingestions




<b>Removing DIL code</b>

1. In your code, identify following function and remove them:

    1. DIL.create
    2. DILinstance.api.signals().submit()
    3. DIL.modules.siteCatalyst.init If you are forwarding data to Adobe Analytics
    4. GA.submitUniversalAnalytics(); OR GA.submitUniversalAnalytics();  If you are forwarding data to Google Analytics
2. Once you have removed above function, ensure that you have removed DIL JS library from your code as well.
