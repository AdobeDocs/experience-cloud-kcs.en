# Is it a specification that "visit_num", "visit_page_num", etc. are displayed as "0" in Data Feed columns?

## Description {#description}

In the Data Feed columns, some data, such as "visit_num" and "visit_page_num" are displayed as "0". When does this occur?
<br> 

## Resolution {#resolution}


This is an excluded hit and is displayed as "0". Specifically, the hit will have one of the "1-16" values in the Data Feed column "exclude_hit".
