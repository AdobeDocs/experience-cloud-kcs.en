# [!DNL Control Panel] Capabilities

## Description


The Adobe Campaign [!DNL Control Panel] allows Adobe Campaign administrators to monitor key assets and perform administrative tasks, such as managing the IP allow listing, SFTP storage by instance, and managing GPG keys or subdomains and certificates. All your [!DNL Campaign] instance’s assets, workflows, and data are stored in the database. The database reaching its maximum capacity can lead to issues with your instance (inability to log in, send emails, etc.). Therefore, it is essential to regularly monitor your instances’ databases to ensure optimal performance.
<br><br> <br><br>
Today, [!DNL Control Panel] has the following functionality, with new features being added frequently and improvements.
