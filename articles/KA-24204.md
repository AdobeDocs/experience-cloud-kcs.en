# Segment names created in Adobe Audience Manager aren't displayed correctly under the 'Audience Names' dimension in AA


Learn why segment names are incorrectly displayed under the 'Audience Names' dimension in Adobe Analytics.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

- Adobe Analytics
- Adobe Audience Manager


### Issue/Symptoms

You created a segment in Adobe Audience Manager; however, its name does not appear correctly under the 'Audience Names' dimension in Adobe Analytics.


## Resolution {#resolution}


In this case, it is possible that for some reason, the segment metadata was not transmitted from Adobe Audience Manager to Adobe Analytics. Therefore, try renaming the segment once in Adobe Audience Manager, saving it, and then reverting it back to its original name. This procedure will ensure that the metadata is transmitted to Adobe Analytics again and the information may be categorized correctly.

Note: Renaming the segment will not impact the existing data.
