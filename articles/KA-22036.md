# SCM-120008 Cannot find key values for element 'Event'


The error *SCM-120008 Cannot find key values for element 'Event'*occurs because the starting order of a workflow in Campaign Classic was the opposite of the order of the one failing. This article explains how to sync the two workflows and resolve the error.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Campaign Classic v7

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

A workflow was failed with the error:
`SCM-120008 Cannot find key values for element 'Event' (document with schema 'workflow', name 'WKFxxxx' and description 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx')`

## Resolution {#resolution}


In this case, the starting order of the workflowsÂ was the opposite of the order on failing ones.

Due to that, the workflow WKFxxxx was expecting an Event that should have been generated by the WKFyyyy workflow.

Change the starting order to WKFyyyy, followed by WKFxxxx.

<b>Cause</b>

- There was no synchronization between the two workflows.
- The Event for the WKFxxxx workflow should be generated by the WKFyyyy workflow.
- But the WKFyyyy workflow was failing since it was not able to find the workflow `Import_RegistrationInitiative_U (WKFxxxx)` started.
