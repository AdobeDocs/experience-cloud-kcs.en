# Campaign Classic V7 - SMS tracking and tiny URL

## Description


What is the way to use tiny URLs which don't take up too many characters whilst still enabling tracking?


## Resolution


We cannot use tiny URLs and enable Adobe Campaign tracking simultaneously. In such a case, the tiny URLs' own tracking services can be used.

<b>Our recommendation</b>:

We would suggest therefore using the actual URL and adjusting the content accordingly.

In that case, the Adobe Campaign would be used for tracking as well.
