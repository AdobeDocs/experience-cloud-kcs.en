# Campaign Classic V7 - SMS tracking and tiny URL

## Description


<b>Environment</b>

- Campaign Classic
- Campaign




<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

How to use tiny URLs that don't take up too many characters while still enabling tracking?


## Resolution


Adobe Campaign tracking cannot be enabled with tiny URLs. The tiny URLs' own tracking services can be used in such a case.

To enable Adobe Campaign tracking use the actual URL and adjust the content accordingly.
