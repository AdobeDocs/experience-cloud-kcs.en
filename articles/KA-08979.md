# Adobe Campaign: How To Use Emoji In Subject Line For Emails

## Description


It has been requested for an example on how to add emojis in the subject line of an email.




## Resolution


Steps to implement:

- When inserting an emoji into a subject line, the required base string formatting is =?UTF-8?Q?=
- Search the hexadecimal code of the desired emoji to insert (for example F0 9F 98 81 on the website http://apps.timwhitlock.info/emoji/tables/unicode)
- Add the hexadecimal code in the base string like the following:
- =?UTF-8?Q?=F0=9F=98=81?=


<b>Additional Information</b>

- It is possible to paste this directly on a delivery subject. The character won't be visible until proofs have been sent, but will be functional. The rendering is on the mailer provider side, but almost all most providers should be able to render these characters.
- Emojis don’t render within Adobe Campaign hence why when saved and then re-opened the emoji is questioned marked.
