# Cleanup workflow fails/does not work and is missing logs

## Description

<br>Environment<br><br>
Campaign Classic
<br><br>Issue/Symptoms<br><br>
While investigating an issue with the cleanup log, there are some situations where the logs are incomplete.

Case scenarios:

- The workflow completes, but old records are still not purged
- The workflow completes, but lines of some steps seem to be missing
- The activity in the workflow flashes red


In all these cases, the error message causing the issue do not appear in the journal log.


## Resolution


Check the `runwf/wfserver` logs, when the workflow run is initiated to identify the error message of theÂ root cause.

In some installations (especially on-premise) these logs may not appear in the workflow log itself, due to app server architecture or some other factors.
