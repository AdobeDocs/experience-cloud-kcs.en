### Issue/Symptoms

This article explains how to change the JBoss log path on AEM Forms in a Windows Server environment.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Follow these steps to change the JBoss log path:

Step 1. If the AEM Forms 6.5.12 services are running, stop them.

Step 2. Execute the following command at the command prompt to uninstall the existing service:

`       sc delete JBoss_for_Adobe_Experience_Manager_Forms_6.5.12`

Step 3. Edit `service.bat` and replace `"!BASE!\log"` with your folder path.
            <u>File</u>:
            C:\Adobe\Adobe_Experience_Manager_Forms\jboss\bin\service.bat
            <u>Line</u>:
            `if "%LOGPATH%"=="" set LOGPATH="!BASE!\log"`

Step 4. Execute `createJBossService.vbs`
            C:\Adobe\Adobe_Experience_Manager_Forms\jboss\bin\createJBossService.vbs

Step 5. Once the "JBoss_for_Adobe_Experience_Manager_Forms_6.5.12" service is registered, start the service.

Step 6. Confirm the log file on changing the folder in Step 3.

Step 7. Adjust the path if you have installed AEM Forms in a non-default location.
