How to disable full-text search by file mime type with custom Tika configuration in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).


## Resolution {#resolution}


Adobe recommends disabling full-text search for binary files via the Tika index.

For more details on Adobe's recommendation and how to optimize asset performance, refer to the [asset performance tuning](https://helpx.adobe.com/ca/experience-manager/kb/Asset-Performance-Tuning.html)Â Helpx article.

<b>Solution 1:</b>

To address Adobe's recommendation, follow these steps:

1. Install the package that is provided.
2. Navigate to the following locations using CRX/DE:
    - `/oak:index/lucene/tika/config.xml`
    - `/oak:index/damAssetLucene/tika/config.xml`
3. Add the file mime type that you want to disable:
    - `<mime>application/zip</mime>`
4. Save the changes.
5. Set the boolean property refresh=true for these nodes using CRX/DE and save the changes:
    - `/oak:index/lucene`


    - `/oak:index/damAssetLucene`
6. Wait for the updated changes.


<b>Solution 2:</b>

For an alternative approach:

1. Search for *Oak-Lucene* in the AEM web console and note the bundle number.
2. Shutdown AEM instance.
3. Navigate to `/crx-quickstart/launchpad/felix/bundlexxx` directory.
4. Go to the subdirectory labeled with versionX.Y, such as felix/bundle102/version0.2 using the `cd`version.
5. Retrieve all the content of the tika-config.xml file from the jar file:
    - `jar -xvf bundle.jar org/apache/jackrabbit/oak/plugins/index/lucene/tika-config.xml`
6. Edit tika-config.xml file:
    - `vi org/apache/jackrabbit/oak/plugins/index/lucene/tika-config.xml`
7. For instance, add the file mime type that you want to disable:
    - `<mime>application/zip</mime>`
8. Save changes to bundle.jar.
9. Restart AEM and verify changes by searching for zip file assets.
