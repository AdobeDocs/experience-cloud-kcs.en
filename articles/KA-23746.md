# Maintenance releases notifications for AEM as a Cloud Service


This article covers the notifications process for AEM as a Cloud Service maintenance releases. Since maintenance updates occur frequently, you may be notified an hour or two before it happens and not weeks in advance.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) as a Cloud Service.

### Issue/Symptoms

Are notifications sent about maintenance releases for AEM as a Cloud Service? If yes, when and how are they sent?


## Resolution {#resolution}


Yes, you do get notified about maintenance releases. After signing in to [experience.adobe.com](https://experience.adobe.com), you can choose to receive [email or in-app notifications](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/using-cloud-manager/notifications.html?lang=en) about them. However, maintenance updates tend to be frequent, therefore, notifications are not sent weeks in advance.

It is recommended that you keep an eye on the Cloud Manager where these notifications come through. When you see an update available on your development environment, it means that there's an update coming up for your stage and production instance as well.

As soon as you see an update available, have one of the development environments updated to the latest version and do all your custom testing and so on.
