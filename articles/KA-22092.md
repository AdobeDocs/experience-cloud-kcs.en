# Adding assets to a translation job fails with "Fail to load data" error

## Resolution {#resolution}


After reproducing the issue locally, it was discovered that the assets in the folder that throw the *Failed to load data*Â error were corrupted, having both the `jcr:title` property and the `dc:title` metadata, and `jcr:title` was defined as a <b>multi-value string</b>.

The property type for `jcr:title` should be <b>String</b>. Having it defined as a string array was causing a type-casting error when the path asset from the folder was being loaded.

Changing the type of `jcr:title` to String and setting the title with the asset's name will solve the issue.
