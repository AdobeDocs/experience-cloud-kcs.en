# Adding assets to a translation job fails with 'Fail to load data' error message

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Attempting to add Assets from a specific folder to a Translation Job fails with the error - '*Fail to load data*'.

## Resolution {#resolution}


After reproducing the issue locally, it was discovered that the assets in the folder that throw the "*Failed to load data*" error were corrupted, having both the `jcr:title` property and the `dc:title` metadata, and `jcr:title` was defined as a multi-value string.

The property type for `jcr:title` should be String. Having it defined as a string array was causing a type casting error when the path asset from the folder was being loaded.

Changing the type of `jcr:title` to String and setting the title with the asset's name solved the issue.
