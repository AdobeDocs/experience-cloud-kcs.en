# Campaign Standard - Unable to extract the [!UICONTROL profile ID] (the [!UICONTROL Primary key]) field.

## Description

Environment

- Campaign Classic
- Campaign
- Campaign Standard



<br>Issue/Symptoms<br>

How to extract the profile ID (the primary key) field?

## Resolution

The new "<b>[!UICONTROL ACS ID]</b>" feature can be used here. This will generate a new field named "acsId" with the type "<b>[!UICONTROL UUID]</b>".

We would be able to see it in the *<b>[!UICONTROL SQL preview]</b>* after the preparation of the publication.

So, its values would be [!UICONTROL UUID].
