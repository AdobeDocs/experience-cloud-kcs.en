# Unable to extract the profile ID (the primary key) field.

## Description

<b>Environment</b>


- Campaign Classic
- Campaign
- Campaign Standard



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>


How to extract the profile ID (the primary key) field?


## Resolution


The new "<b>*ACS ID</b>*" feature can be used here. This will generate a new field named "<b>`acsId`</b>" with the type "<b>`UUID`</b>".

 We would be able to see it in the <b>*SQL preview</b>* after the preparation of the publication.

 So, its values would be <b>`UUID`</b>.
