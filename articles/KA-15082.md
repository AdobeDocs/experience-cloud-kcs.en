# Campaign Standard - Unable to extract the [!UICONTROL profile ID (the primary key)] field. Is there any other way to do this?

## Description


<b>Question</b>: It is not possible to extract the [!UICONTROL profile ID] (the [!UICONTROL primary key)] field? Is there any other way possible to do this?


## Resolution


The new "<b>ACS ID</b>" feature can be used here. This will generate a new field named "acsId" with the type "<b>UUID</b>".

We would be able to see it in the <b>*SQL preview</b><ex id="2"/> after the preparation of the publication.*

So, its values would be UUID.
