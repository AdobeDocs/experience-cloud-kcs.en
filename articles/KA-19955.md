# Brand Portal Dynamic Media Preview broken

## Description


We are facing an issue in Brand Portal: Dynamic Media Preview broken in Brand Portal
 The initial image preview at the assetdetails page in Brand Portal is not visible. This issue occurs for assets which have been synced to DMS7 on AEM and which were published to Brand Portal afterwards.


## Resolution


You would need to put in the Dynamic Media configuration in BrandPortal the very same credentials/settings as the Dynamic Media cloud config in AEMaaCS. This will then request dynamicmedia renditions from the secure test server of Dynamic Media. In order to allow that, the egress IP address of the BrandPortal system of your region will need to be added to the IP filter in Dynamic Media Classic app - [!UICONTROL Setup] - [!UICONTROL Application Setup] - [!UICONTROL Publish Setup] - [!UICONTROL Image Server] - [!UICONTROL Publish Context]: [!UICONTROL Test Image Serving] - [!UICONTROL Client Address Filter].

The egress IP is documented here: https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-brand-portal/using/download/dynamic-video-brand-portal.html?lang=en#allowlist-public-egress-ips-for-dynamic-media-scene7-mode
