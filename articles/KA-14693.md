# Notifications sent from the wrong domain after database refresh.

## Description


Workflow notifications after database refresh sent from production domain and links in the content redirect to the production workflows.


## Resolution


Check if after refresh:

- in Deployment Wizard, sender mask and address point to Stage and not production

- check if the options below point to stage and not production:
     NmsDelivery_FromAddressMasks
     NmsDelivery_ErrorAddressMasks
     NmsServer_URL
     NmsServer_IntranetURL

- check if the notification templates have the "From" field empty - if they do, they will pick up the options values. Templates must be found under Administration - Campaign Management - Technical Delivery templates.



If all is good there but notifications are still sent from the wrong domain:

The approval/notification emails are all sent from the same technical recurring delivery that was analyzed and prepared long ago when the parameters were still pointing to production.

This means that any changes made in the options are not considered in these notification emails, as no new delivery preparation had to be done.

To fix it, stop the technical delivery 'Notification of the assignees for a workflow task' under 'Administration  Production  Objects created automatically  Technical deliveries  Workflow notifications.' A new notification will create a new delivery with the latest and correct variables.
