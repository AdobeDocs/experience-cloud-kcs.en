# Stop Analytics Media (video) data from being forwarded to AAM

## Description

How does one prevent Analytics media (video) data from being forwarded to AAM?

## Resolution


If one does not want their Analytics media/video tracking data to be forwarded to Audience Manager then the analytics.optOutServerSideForwarding setting can be set to true in Media Collection API implementations.
