# Performance test always access site root page

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Experience Manager
 AdobeÂ Cloud Manager

<b>Issue</b>
 Performance test of Cloud Manager always accesses the site root page, even if the test set is new pages.
 Site root page means the URL without path (For example: *https://www.example.com*).
 If the site root page is not accessible, the performance test will fail.


## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Solution</b>
This is the expected behavior.
The "new" pages selection refers to the actual performance test.
The crawler is executed first in order to identify which pages are available.
