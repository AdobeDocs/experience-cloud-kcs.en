# Passing custom parameter in a web-app host URL to identify a record


Learn how to pass custom parameter in a web-app host URL to identify a record

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Campaign Classic

### Issue/Symptoms

Use case- The recipient table has been extended to add two custom columns. The first column has a unique identifier to identify a recipient record—the second column stores the same identifier in an encrypted format. A new created custom workflow has been created to encrypt all the values of the first column and store them in the corresponding second column.

This encrypted record needs to be used to identify a recipient in the web-app.

For example, the web-app URL should look like [<b>https://clientsurl/unsubscribe/value/TVGr4UfKr9%2BuNlQulVDy2w%3D%3D</b>](https://clientsurl/unsubscribe/value/TVGr4UfKr9%2BuNlQulVDy2w%3D%3D) and <b>`TVGr4UfKr9%2BuNlQulVDy2w%3D%3D`</b> is the encrypted value. However, as soon as this URL is passed in a browser, the browser, considers <b>%2B </b>and <b>%3D</b> as special characters and encodes it to[<b>https://clientsurl/unsubscribe/value/TVGr4UfKr9+uNlQulVDy2w==</b>](https://&nbsp;https://clientsurl/unsubscribe/value/TVGr4UfKr9+uNlQulVDy2w==).


## Resolution {#resolution}


The browser might be converting the special characters under the URL encoding scheme, since <b>encrypted identifier (extended column)</b> was not passed as a query parameter in the URL.

To solve this, a separator and a pass should be used in the <b>encrypted identifier</b> as a query parameter so that the browser won't decode it.

<b>For example</b>: Use [<b>https://clientsurl/webApp/unsub?`<` encrypted identifier column name`>` =TVGr4UfKr9%2BuNlQulVDy2w%3D%3D</b>](https://clientsurl/webApp/unsub?<encrypted%20identifier%20column%20name>=TVGr4UfKr9%2BuNlQulVDy2w%3D%3D) *instead of*[<b>https://clientsurl/unsubscribe/value/TVGr4UfKr9%2BuNlQulVDy2w%3D%3D</b>](https://clientsurl/unsubscribe/value/TVGr4UfKr9%2BuNlQulVDy2w%3D%3D)

Modify the un-subscription part of the web-app so that it takes this respective parameter into consideration for unsubscribing the recipient.
