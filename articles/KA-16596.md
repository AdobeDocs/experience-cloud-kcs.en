# Update Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy for Activity Map

## Description

<b>Environment </b>
- Customer Journey Analytics
- Analytics



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
Sometimes, the Activity Map tool cannot load in the browser due to the <b>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</b> policy on customer's website domain. This can be validated by looking at the *Console* errors, which will show an error like this:

Refused to frame 'https://sitecatalyst.omniture.com/' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "frame-src \*.xyz.com \*.facebook.com c.comenity.net \*.google.com...


## Resolution


To fix this, update <b>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) </b>policy as below to have Activity Map work on site:

Wild card domains

- For 'connect-src', add sitecatalyst.omniture.com
- For 'frame-src', add \*.omniture.com


No wild card domains

- For 'connect-src', add sitecatalyst.omniture.com
- For 'frame-src', add sitecatalyst.omniture.com authorize.omniture.com sc5.omniture.com


The thing to take note of for the *No wild card domains*, is that we have *sc5.omniture.com*. This is for a company in Pacific Northwest (PNW) data center. If the company was in the:

- London data center, use sc3.omniture.com
- Singapore data center, use sc4.omniture.com


We recommend using the <b>wild card domains</b>, in case the Experience Cloud Login process ever changes in the future and uses different domains.
