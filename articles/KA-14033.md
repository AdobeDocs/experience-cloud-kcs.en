# Adobe Campaign: Will Adobe Campaign automatically retry workflows once a deadlock has been cleared?

## Description


It has been asked if Adobe Campaign hits a deadlock while a workflow is trying to use the deadlocked table, will the workflow automatically detect when the deadlock is free and execute the workflow.


## Resolution


An enhancement was requested in NEO-13610 and this functionality now exists in Campaign Classic builds starting 9026.
