# Will Adobe Campaign automatically retry workflows once a deadlock has been cleared?

## Description


<b>Environment</b>

- Campaign Classic
- Campaign




<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

If Adobe Campaign hits a deadlock while a workflow is trying to use the deadlocked table, will the workflow automatically detect when the deadlock is free and execute the workflow?
<br><br>Â <br>

## Resolution


An enhancement was requested in NEO-13610, and this functionality now exists in Campaign Classic builds starting 9026.
