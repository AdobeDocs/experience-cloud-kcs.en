# Does Adobe Campaign automatically retry workflows once a deadlock is cleared


In Campaign Classic builds starting 9026, it should automatically be able to detect when the deadlock is free and re-execute the workflow.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Campaign Classic

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

If Adobe Campaign hits a deadlock while a workflow is trying to use the deadlocked table, will the workflow automatically detect when the deadlock is free and execute the workflow?
<br>Â 

## Resolution {#resolution}


An enhancement was requested in NEO-13610, and this functionality now exists in Campaign Classic builds starting 9026.
