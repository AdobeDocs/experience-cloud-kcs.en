# Package installation issue on AEMaaCS


If you get an error while installing a package on AEMaaCS, it may contain an immutable path. This article will help you fix the error and successfully install the package.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Experience Manager as a Cloud Service



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

When trying to install a package on an AEM as a Cloud Service (AEMaaCS) instance, the customer receives the error:

*Package (or its subpackage(s)) contains application content which isn't supported at runtime.*



The package can be successfully installed on an On-Premise instance or on a local SDK.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The package the customer is trying to install contains <b>/apps</b> and it cannot be uploaded to an AEMaaCS instance via the package manager if it contains any immutable path.
At runtime only mutable areas like <b>/content, /conf, etc.</b> can be modified.

This package should be deployed via the <b>cloud manager pipeline, embedding it in the *all* module.</b>

Also, please make sure that a third-party package is cloud service compatible.
