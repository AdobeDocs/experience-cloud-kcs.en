# Target Mode Doesn't Appear on Sites

## Description {#description}


As per `[` 0`]` , Target is successfully activated for experience fragments with IMS. However this does not in Sites. The Targeting option doesn't appear in the list of modes.

`[` 0`]`  [https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/administering/integration/integration-target-ims.html?lang=en](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/administering/integration/integration-target-ims.html?lang=en)


## Resolution {#resolution}


By default AEM CS checks for contexthub in the '/etc/cloudsettings/default/contexthub/' path. If codebase is '/libs/settings/cloudsettings/legacy/contexthub' then remove the default path in 'Page Properties' under 'Personalization' and 'Targeting Mode' will appear. The contexthub bundle does not check under libs anymore when the path under '/etc/' does not exist, and this results in the contexthub not being included on the page.
