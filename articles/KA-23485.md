# Target mode doesn't appear on Sites


This article provides a fix for the AEMaaCS issue where the <b>Targeting Mode</b> doesn't appear in Sites. To resolve this, remove the default path in <b>Page Properties</b> under <b>Personalization</b> if the codebase is `/libs/settings/cloudsettings/legacy/contexthub`.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service (AEMaaCS)

### Issue/Symptoms

As per the [Integration with Adobe Target using IMS](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/content/sites/administering/integration/integration-target-ims.html) user guide, Target is successfully activated for experience fragments with IMS. However, this doesn't happen in Sites. The <b>Targeting mode</b> doesn't appear in the list of modes.


## Resolution {#resolution}


By default, AEMaaCS checks for contexthub in the `/etc/cloudsettings/default/contexthub/` path. If the codebase is `/libs/settings/cloudsettings/legacy/contexthub`, then remove the default path in <b>Page Properties</b> under <b>Personalization</b>, and then <b>Targeting Mode</b> will appear. The contexthub bundle doesn't check under `libs` anymore when the path under `/etc/` doesn't exist, and this results in the contexthub not being included on the page.
