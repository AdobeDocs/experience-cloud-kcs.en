# Creating new projects for translated pages | AEM


In Adobe Experience Manager, when language copies are updated without any changes to the source page, a new project is not generated as anticipated. However, when modifications are made, updating the language copies results in the creation of a new project.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

The customer discovered that even though the creation of a new project is selected, it would not be produced while trying to update a translation.

<b>Steps to reproduce:</b>

1. Choose a page that already has at least one language copy created.


2. Go to <b>References</b> `>`  <b>Language copies</b> and select one or more language copies.


3. Go to <b>Update Language Copies</b> and choose <b>Create Multi-language Translation Project</b> under the <b>Project</b> tab.


4. Add a title to the project and click <b>Update.</b>


5. Go to the <b>Author start</b> page `>`  <b>Projects</b> and you will notice that no new project has been created.



## Resolution {#resolution}


Upon attempting to replicate the issue locally, it was found that no project is created if there are no alterations made to the source page while updating the language copies. However, if a change is made, a new project is generated when the language copies are updated.
