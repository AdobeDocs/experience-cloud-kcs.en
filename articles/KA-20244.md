# Creating new projects for translated pages

## Description


The customer discovered that even though the creation of a new project is selected, it would not be produced while trying to update a translation.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Choose a page that already has at least one language copy created

2. Go to References - Language copies and select one or more language copies

3. Go to Update Language Copies and choose "Create Multi-language Translation Project" under the Project tab

4. Add a title to the project and click "Update"

Go to the Author start page - Projects and you will see that no new project has been created.


## Resolution


When attempting to replicate the problem locally, it was discovered that no project is formed if no changes are made to the source page when updating the language copies.

However, once a modification is performed, a new project is created upon updating the language copies.
