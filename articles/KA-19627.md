# Discrepancy in trait Vs segment device count

## Description

<b>Use case:</b><br><br>I have the following data source established to receive data from one of our partners:<br><br><br>
000111 - Data Source to receive TestInternalCompany

We have created some segments using this data. The 2 in question are:

1111111- Existing Customers without Home
 222222- Existing Customers with Home

When looking at the segment size compared to the trait size there is a big difference. Additionally, comparing the total segment size to the real-time segment size, there is also a big difference.

Example:

Existing Customers without Home
 Unique Trait Realization size - (30 day lookback) 360,226
 Total Segment population - (30 day lookback) 478,695
 Real time Segment size - (30 day look back) 21,756

Existing Customers with Home
 Unique Trait Realization size - (30 day lookback) 9,058,573
 Total Segment population - (30 day lookback) 9,205,534
 Real-time Segment size - (30 day look back) 199,191



Please explain above behavior.


## Resolution


So, here we are trying to understand the difference between:
 1. Trait Unique Trait Realization (UTR) and Total segment population.
 2. Real-Time segment population and Total segment population.



<u>Trait Unique Trait Realization (UTR) and Total segment population.</u>

- If you want to compare trait's data with segment then it should be done on the basis of total population on both sides.
- UTR is just addition of new devices during that window while total segment population is the total count of devices currently present in a given segment.
- Total trait population should align with total segment population considering the Profile Merge Rules in your segment.
- If you are using Profile Merge Rule as "Last Auth + Profile Link Device Graph" then higher total segment population is expected as Profile Link Device Graph, considers upto 100 devices per profile for segmentation.
- Comparing, UTR with total with segment population is simplyÂ not a correct comparison.




<u>Real-Time segment population and Total segment population.</u>

- Real-time segment population is the count of devices which are seen online in the give lookback window out of the total segment population.
- So, if less devices are seen online then the real-time count is expected to be less than the total segment population.
