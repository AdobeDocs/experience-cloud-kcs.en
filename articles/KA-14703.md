# Total number of users for each product in Admin Console

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

- Customer Journey Analytics
- Analytics




<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

What does the total number of users for each product under the Overview tab in the Admin Console represent?




## Resolution {#resolution}


Each product tile shows the number of users. This is not the actual number of users for each individual product. It is the sum of *ENTITLED USERS*for the product. For example*, s*uppose the total users under the Overview tab in Admin Console Analytics are 2012. This number will match the figures in *ENTITLED USERS*in Product Profiles. This means the number of users, i.e., 2012, is a duplicated number where a user that exists in two product profiles would be counted twice. Follow these steps to check.

<b>Steps to reproduce:</b>

- Go to <b>Admin Console </b>`>` <b> Overview </b>to check the total users.
- To validate this number, go to <b>Admin Console </b>`>`  <b>Products</b> `>`  select <b>Analytics </b>`>`  <b>Product Profiles </b>and count the number of *ENTITLED USERS*.




<b>Expected results:</b>

Total users in Product Profiles match the total users in the Overview tab of Admin Console Analytics.
