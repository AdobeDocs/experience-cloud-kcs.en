# Total number of users for each product in Admin Console

## Description


What does the total number of users for each product under [!UICONTROL Overview] tab in [!DNL Admin Console] represent?

Steps: Admin Console - Overview

<b>Notice:</b> Each product tile shows number of users




## Resolution


This is not the actual number of users for each individual product. It is the sum of 'ENTITLED USERS' for the product.

*For example:* Under [!UICONTROL Overview] tab in Admin Console [!DNL Analytics] users are 2012

Now to validate this number go to Admin Console - [!UICONTROL Products] - select [!DNL Analytics] - Product Profiles and count the number of 'ENTITLED USERS'. This comes out to be 2012.

This means the number of users i.e 2012 (in the above example)Â is a duplicated number where a user that exists in 2 product profiles would be counted twice.
