# No Project Template Available

## Description

Although the customer's user has all the necessary privileges assigned in the Admin Console, including Admin rights, whenever trying to create a new project from *AEM Start - Projects - Create - Project* there is no project template available hence, no project can be created.<br><br><br>
According to 1,  AEM ships with three different templates out of the box:

- A simple project - A reference sample for any projects that do not fit into other categories (a catch-all). It includes three basic roles (Owners, Editors, and Observers) and four workflows (Project Approval, Request Launch, Request Landing Page and Request Email).
- A media project - A reference sample project for media-related activities. It includes several media-related project roles (Photographers, Editors, Copywriters, Designers, Owners, and Observers).
- A [translation project](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/sites/administering/reusing-content/translation/overview.html?lang=en) - A reference sample for managing translation-related activities. It includes three basic roles (Owners, Editors, and Observers). It includes two workflows that are accessed in the Workflows user interface.

## Resolution


For the project templates to be visible in AEM, the property - <b>cq:allowedTemplates</b> of type <b>String</b> and the value <b>/(apps|libs)/.\*/projects/templates/.\</b>* must be present under <b>/content/projects/jcr:content</b>.

It was found that the issue was caused by the fact that the customer had no jcr:content node under /content/projects. After creating the jcr:content node and adding the cq:allowedTemplates attribute the customer could see all three project templates.
