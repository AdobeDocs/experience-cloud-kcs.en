# No Project Template Available

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Experience Manager


###  

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
<br>Although the customer's user has all the necessary privileges assigned in the Admin Console, including Admin rights, whenever trying to create a new project from <b>AEM Start </b>`>`  <b>Projects</b> `>`  <b>Create</b> `>`  <b>Project</b>, there is no project template available hence, no project can be created.<br>
According to the user guide, [AEM ships with three different templates](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/sites/authoring/projects/overview.html?lang=en#project-templates)out of the box:

- A simple project: A reference sample for any projects that do not fit into other categories (a catch-all). It includes three basic roles (Owners, Editors, and Observers) and four workflows (Project Approval, Request Launch, Request Landing Page, and Request Email).
- A media project: A reference sample project for media-related activities. It includes several media-related project roles (Photographers, Editors, Copywriters, Designers, Owners, and Observers).
- A [translation project](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/sites/administering/reusing-content/translation/overview.html?lang=en): A reference sample for managing translation-related activities. It includes three basic roles (Owners, Editors, and Observers). It includes two workflows that are accessed in the Workflows user interface.

## Resolution {#resolution}


For the project templates to be visible in AEM, the property `cq:allowedTemplates` of type `String`[` `]`` and the value <b>/(apps|libs)/.\*/projects/templates/.\* </b> must be present under <b>/content/projects/jcr:content</b>.

It was found that the issue was caused by the fact that the customer had no `jcr:content node` under */content/projects*. After creating the `jcr:content node` and adding the `cq:allowedTemplates` attribute, the customer could see all three project templates.
