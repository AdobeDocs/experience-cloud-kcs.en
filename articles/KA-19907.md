# Data Warehouse connection to AWS S3 SFTP server failed

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Customer Journey Analytics
- Analytics


### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

While implementing Data Warehouse connection to AWS S3 SFTP server by referring "[Send Data Warehouse requests to SFTP servers](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/export/ftp-and-sftp/secure-file-transfer-protocol/ftp-sftp-dw.html?lang=en)" document, it fails to connect due to the problem of reading public key.

<b>AWS S3</b> - Amazon Simple Storage Service

<b>SFTP</b> - Secure File Transfer Protocol


## Resolution {#resolution}


You need to consult your System Administrator or Vendor (e.g. AWS) for your SFTP server to determine the correct action to install the public key.

<b>Cause</b>

Any implementation of SFTP outside of OpenSSH (Secure Shell) may have a completely different mechanism for installing public keys for authorized logins.

That means you need to consult your System Administrator or VendorÂ for Step3 of "[Send Data Warehouse requests to SFTP servers](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/export/ftp-and-sftp/secure-file-transfer-protocol/ftp-sftp-dw.html?lang=en)".

Step3: In the root directory, navigate to the folder named `.ssh` (if one does not exist, create one) and place the `authorized_keys` file there.
