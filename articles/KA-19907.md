# Data Warehouse connection fail to AWS S3 SFTP server

## Description

Implemented Data Warehouse connection to AWS S3 SFTP server by referring "[Send Data Warehouse requests to SFTP servers](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/export/ftp-and-sftp/secure-file-transfer-protocol/ftp-sftp-dw.html?lang=en)" document, but failed to connect due to problem of reading public key.<br><br> <br><br><br>
&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;


## Resolution


Customer need consult their System Administrator or Vendor(e.g. AWS) for their SFTP server to determine the correct action to install the public key.

Root Cause:
Any implementation of [!DNL SFTP] outside of OpenSSH may have a completely different mechanism for installing public keys for authorized logins.

That mean customer need consult their System Administrator or Vendor for Step3 of "[Send Data Warehouse requests to SFTP servers](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/export/ftp-and-sftp/secure-file-transfer-protocol/ftp-sftp-dw.html?lang=en)".

Step3: In the root directory, navigate to the folder named .ssh (if one does not exist, create one) and place the [!DNL authorized_keys] file there.
