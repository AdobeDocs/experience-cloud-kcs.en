# Error: XSV-350064 in Google BigQuery external account

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b><br>Campaign Classic v7<br> <br><b>Issue/Symptoms</b><br>While trying to configure the external account for <b>Google BigQuery</b> external database, when we click on test connection, we get these errors:
 <br>XSV-350064 - To access remote databases you need to specify the data time zone<br>XSV-350062 - Unable to start data source<br> <br>![](assets/___4cf452a2-a3de-ed11-a7c7-6045bd0065b6___.png)<br>
<b>Steps to follow:</b>

- Go to the External Accounts.
- Click on <b>Create and Choose Type</b> and select <b>Big Query Google</b> and fill in all the other details.
- Click on <b>Test the connection</b> and then error appears.



## Resolution {#resolution}


In order to reset the value for the field `timezone`, you need to change the type to <b>PostgreSQL</b> (that has a *timezone* field in UI), and here you can choose a value and then save the external account.

Afterwards, change the type to <b>Google Big Query </b>again and resubstitute old data and check the <b>Edit XML file</b> (this should now have a value for *timezone*).

Also, test the connection again and ensure that there is no more error regarding the timezone.


<b>Cause:</b>
After checking the Edit XML file, we could see there is no value for *timezone* field (`timezone=""`)
