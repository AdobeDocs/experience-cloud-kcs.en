## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Solution</b>

Segments with (`+` `&` `,` `%` `:` `;` `@` `/` `=` `?` `$`) in their name cannot be mapped to a Twitter destination, due to limitations in the Twitter API.

When creating the Twitter destination (or when mapping new segments to an existing Twitter destination), be sure to select only segments that do not have these characters.

If a segment needs to be sent to Twitter and has these characters in the title, then change the segment name before mapping to Twitter.
