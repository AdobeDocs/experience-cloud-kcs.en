# how to implement target-global-mbox (at.js 2.x) for a SPA inside of iframe

## Description


Our newly developed mobileweb (MW) experience is an Angular based SPA that will be hosted inside of iFrame on many of our client's sites. We plan to implement at.js 2.x using Tealium (TMS).

Since Target VEC (visual based exp composer) doesn't support iframe, we are exploring FEC option (form based exp composer). Below are some FEC topics that we are running researches on:



1. Do we still need to create multiple reginal mbox using get/applyoffer function or we can just utilize one global mbox?
2. If the latter, is there any resource that shows how to do so?
3. Can we implement both global and reginal mbox for our MW SPA?



## Resolution


1. Regional mboxes can be created using getOffer/applyOffer individually as well as in batch using getOffers/applyOffers. Additionally you can use the FEC using the [!DNL Target] Global Mbox as well if preferred.
2. If you wish to use AT.js to execute the content, the offer code must be delivered as HTML/JavaScript. Other offer code types (JSON etc.) can be used if the app will consume it and render experience.
3. Both global and regional mboxes can be used in SPA. Both types of mboxes can be made compatible with a SPA with the right design and architecture.
