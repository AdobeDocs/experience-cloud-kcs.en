# DDoS attack or bot overloading AEM with traffic


Debug this issue by enabling logging enabled at the dispatcher level, and take steps to improve dispatcher caching, which helps avoid outages caused by traffic spikes.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Experience Manager 6.x (AEM 6.x)

AEM Dispatcher

Adobe Communique 5.x (Adobe CQ5.x)

### Issue

The site is overloaded by abnormal traffic.

### Cause

Potential causes could be any of these:

- Denial of Service attack (DDoS)
- Search bot or scraping bot hitting expensive URLs
- Extra traffic spike due to a popular article, press release, etc.



## Resolution {#resolution}


To debug such an issue, it is best to have proper logging enabled at the dispatcher level.

Follow these steps:

<b>Step 1: ENABLE LOGGING OF THE `X-FORWARDED-FOR` HEADER</b>:

<b>Apache</b>:

In the Apache HTTP Server's `access_log`, add this to the `httpd.conf` file in the dispatcher servers:


```
LogFormat "%{X-Forwarded-For}i %h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" combined
LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b" common
LogFormat "%{Referer}i -> %U" referer
LogFormat "%{User-agent}i" agent
```


<b>IIS</b>:

In Microsoft IIS, add `X-Forwarded-For` in the "[Advanced Logging](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/get-started/whats-new-in-iis-85/enhanced-logging-for-iis85)" configuration.

That would log the correct end-user IP.

Use the output showing the IP and User-Agent to analyze whether it is a malicious attack, and block the offending IPs if it makes sense.

<b>Step 2: SET DISPATCHER.LOG'S LOG LEVEL TO DEBUG</b>:

<b>Apache</b>:

In the httpd configuration files, there should be a section for the dispatcher. Set `DispatcherLogLevel` to *3*:

`DispatcherLogLevel 3`

<b>IIS</b>:

Modify the `dis_iis.ini` and set the `loglevel` to *3*:

`loglevel=3`
