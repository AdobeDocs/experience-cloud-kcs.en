## Resolution {#resolution}


This occurs since the current date resides outside the valid date range for the account. Work with an Analytics administrator in your organization to extend the valid date range of the login. Adobe Customer Support is not authorized to change valid login date ranges for user accounts.

1. As an Analytics administrator, go to Adobe Analytics `>`  Admin `>`  Analytics users & assets
2. Select a User ID in question
3. In User Management window, extend the valid date range 'Login valid from (mm/dd/yy):' and 'to (mm/dd/yy):'. Or, just uncheck the checkbox.
