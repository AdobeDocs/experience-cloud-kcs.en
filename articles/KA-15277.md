## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Campaign Standard

<b>Issue</b>

<b>Solution</b>
To create aÂ <b>Control Type</b> rule, follow these steps:

1. Export in a package a typology rule of type "control".
2. Update the exported xml file to adapt with your needs.
3. Import the changed xml file.
