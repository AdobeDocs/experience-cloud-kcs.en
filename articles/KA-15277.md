# Adobe Campaign Standard: How can I add a Control Type Typology rules

## Description


It has been noted that by default in ACS users are unable to add Control Type typology rules.Â  The reason for this is to limit the risk of bad scripting or security issues.


## Resolution


That said, if a Control type rule does need to be created the steps below can be followed:

1. Export in a package a typology rule of type "control".
 2. Update the exported xml file to adapt with your needs.
 3. Import the changed xml file .
