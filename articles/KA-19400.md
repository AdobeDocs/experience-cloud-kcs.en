# Error "The requested database record does not exist"

## Description {#description}


Occasionally, when trying to start a workflow one might experience issues and the following error message appears:

- "SQL Statement ......"
- "The requested database record does not exist."
- "Cannot load document of type (`instance_table`)Â satisfying condition (condition) "


This error sometimes shows even if the record in the database exists.

This impacts only a few users, and the admins are able to run the workflow without error.


## Resolution {#resolution}


This can be a rights issue. Indeed, the folder in which the workflow is created is unavailable to the operator. The workflow is visible in the current folder but belongs to the <b>"Administration  Production  Objects Created automatically  Campaign Workflows"</b> folder, to which the user does not have the rights.

Granting the folder rights to the user will correct the issue.
