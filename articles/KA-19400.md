# Error "The requested database record does not exist"

## Description


Occasionally you experience following issue when trying to start a workflow, the following error message appears:

- "SQL Statement ......"

- "The requested database record does not exist."

- "Cannot load document of type (instance_table)Â satisfying condition (condition) "

This even if the record in the database did exist.

This was only impacting some users, and the admins were able to run the workflow without error.


## Resolution


This can be a rights issue. Indeed, the folder in which the workflow was created was unavailable to the operator. The workflow was visible in the current folder but belonged to the "[!UICONTROL Administration] - [!UICONTROL Production] - [!UICONTROL Objects created automatically] - [!UICONTROL Campaign Workflows]" folder, to which the user did not have the rights.

Granting the rights to the folder to the user corrected the issue.
