# Distribution Queue blocked with AccessDeniedException


When attempting to replicate Page content, XF, or other resources using Quick Publish, Manage Publication, or Replicate, the Distribution Queue on the Author becomes blocked. You can verify this by checking the *publish* Distribution Queue from the Distribution UI (<b>AEM `>`  Tools `>`  Deployment `>`  Distribution</b>). Follow the steps provided in this document to resolve the issue.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Experience Manager
- Experience Manager as a cloud service




### <b>Issues/Symptoms</b>

When trying to replicate some Page content (or XF and other kind of resources) using the "Quick Publish", "Manage Publication" or "Replicate", the Distribution Queue on Author gets <b>Blocked</b>.



This can be observed by checking the *publish*Distribution Queue from the Distribution UI (AEM - Tools - Deployment - Distribution):

## Resolution {#resolution}


Despite the error being <b>`javax.jcr.AccessDeniedException`</b>, there is possibly no relation with the ACL / permissions for the distribution service users, though this should be considered if the following scenario does not apply to your case.



Diagnostics

The above error can occur in some situation, when the replicated content does have a specific configuration related to the special <b>jcr:lockIsDeep</b> property.

In order to confirm the diagnostic, you will have to inspect <b>each of the mentioned path</b> with any of the following tool that you can access/is applicable:

1. CRX/DE for DEV instances
2. the [Repository Browser](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/developer-tools/repository-browser.html?lang=en)
3. creating a content package in the Package Manager (this option is also part of the resolution)


Then you need to check the <b>`jcr:content`</b> node for each path found in the Distribution Queue UI, and verify if:

- It <b>does </b>have a <b>`jcr:lockIsDeep`="(Boolean)true"</b> property
- It <b>does not </b>have a <b>`jcr:lockOwner="xxx"`</b> property
- <b>(</b>it <b>does not</b> have a <b>`mix:lockable`</b> value in the <b>`jcr:mixinTypes`</b>)


![](assets/e5fb7aa2-d8bd-ed11-83ff-6045bd0065b6.png)

If this is the case, then the issue is confirmed, since the <b>`jcr:lockIsDeep`</b> property should not be present alone. This property should always be set conjointly with the <b>`jcr:lockOwner`</b> when <b>Locking</b> a page.

It is not possible to only set the <b>`jcr:lockIsDeep`</b> property, even by using the JCR API, so the root cause explaining this situation is mostly by having installed a *corrupted* content package with that single property.



<u><b>Resolution</b></u>

To fix the content the only solution is to install a package in your Author that has the correct properties set on the corresponding node.

You can either create that package from another instance having the corresponding content or if you only have this content on the impacted instance then you can follow these instructions:

1. Generate a package on the broken instance for the faulty page
2. Download the package
3. Extract the <b>`.content.xml`</b> for the page/jcr:content
4. Manually remove the line with the <b>jcr:lockIsDeep</b>
5. Update your package with the new/fixed .content.xml
6. Re-upload and install the modified package


Check the page properties again, and successfully test the replication/distribution.
