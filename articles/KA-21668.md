# Distribution Queue blocked with AccessDeniedException

## Description {#description}

When trying to replicate some Page content (or XF and other kind of resources) using the "Quick Publish", "Manage Publication" or "Replicate", the Distribution Queue on Author get <b>Blocked</b>.<br>One can check the Distribution Queue from the Distribution UI (AEM -Tools - Deployment - Distribution - publish):<br>![](assets/___c8fc3e05-68be-ed11-83ff-6045bd0065b6___.png)<br>Selecting the Golden Publisher queue (entry in bold from the list), more details are given and in particular the involved <b>PATH</b> (there can be multiple elements here):<br>![](assets/___d5fc3e05-68be-ed11-83ff-6045bd0065b6___.png)<br>Looking into the <b>Logs</b> tab will show the following corresponding error:<br>2023/03/08 12:11:26:238 - INFO - Request accepted with distribution package PackageMessage(pubSlingId=a1133c97-6809-411e-a435-4eea0ecbe889, reqType=ADD, pkgId=dstrpck-1678277486031-63159f4b-c577-4079-8741-d41660597d20, pkgType=journal_filevault, pkgLength=6330, pubAgentName=publish, userId=replication-service, paths=/content/wknd/fr, deepPaths=) at offset=158705

..<br>You need to *Clear Queue* (o remove that item) to unblock the queue.

## Resolution {#resolution}


Despite the error being <b>javax.jcr.AccessDeniedException</b>, there is possibly no relation with the ACL / permissions for the distribution service users, though this should be considered if the following scenario does not apply to your case.



<u><b>Diagnostic</b></u>

The above error can occur in some situation, when the replicated content does have a specific configuration related to the special <b>jcr:lockIsDeep</b> property.

In order to confirm the diagnostic, you will have to inspect <b>each of the mentioned path</b> with any of the following tool that you can access/is applicable:

1. CRX/DE for DEV instances
2. the [Repository Browser](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/developer-tools/repository-browser.html?lang=en)
3. creating a content package in the Package Manager (this option is also part of the resolution)


Then you need to check the <b>jcr:content</b> node for each path found in the Distribution Queue UI, and verify if:

- it <b>does </b>have a <b>jcr:lockIsDeep="(Boolean)true"</b> property
- it <b>does not </b>have a <b>jcr:lockOwner="xxx"</b> property
- <b>(</b>it <b>does not</b> have a <b>mix:lockable</b> value in the <b>jcr:mixinTypes</b>)


![](assets/e5fb7aa2-d8bd-ed11-83ff-6045bd0065b6.png)

If this is the case, then the issue is confirmed, since the <b>jcr:lockIsDeep</b> property should not be present alone. This property should always be set conjointly with the <b>jcr:lockOwner</b> when <b>Locking</b> a page.



<u><b>Resolution</b></u>

To fix your content the only solution is to install a package in your Author that has the correct properties set on the corresponding node.

You can either create that package from another instance having the corresponding content, or if you only have this content on the impacted instance then you can follow those instructions:

1. generate a package on broken instance for the faulty page
2. download the package
3. extract the <b>.content.xml</b> for the page/jcr:content
4. remove manually the line with the <b>jcr:lockIsDeep</b>
5. update your package with the new/fixed .content.xml
6. re-upload and install the modified package


You can then check the page properties again, and test successfully the replication/distribution.
