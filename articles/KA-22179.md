# Images not showing in email designer

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Standard

### Issue/Symptoms

Images uploaded to emails/deliveries in the Adobe Campaign Standard instance are not showing (shows broken image icon) in the email designer interface.

<b>Steps to reproduce:</b>

1. Log into the ACS instance.
2. Navigate to <b>Marketing Activities</b>.
3. Select deliveries from the filtering menu on the left.
4. Open any delivery and click on it.
5. On the <b>Content tab</b>,<b> </b>click on the broken image icon.


To confirm if this is a certificate issue, follow the steps to reproduce. Then, open the Chrome DevTool using the keypad shortcut Ctrl+Shift+J. Navigate to the Console tab to view the error message: *"Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID".*


## Resolution {#resolution}


Use Control Panel to verify the subdomain and install the SSL certificate.

Another way to solve the issue is to update the `publicResourceConfig` with [https://res.domainname.jp/res](https://res.domainname.jp/res) (this should be done by Tech Ops request). Make sure that the domain name from [https://res.domainname.jp/res](https://res.domainname.jp/res) is a domain with valid SSL certificates.

### <b>Cause</b>

Subdomains/Certificates not verified in the Control Panel. There is no SSL certificate for a subdomain.
