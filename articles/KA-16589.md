# How to insert an iframe as an offer in the Target experience?

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
Target


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
Is it possible to set up an A/B test based on an Adobe audience segment that controls an iframe?



<b>Example:</b> Variant A contains one iframe content. Variant B contains another iframe content.

How to set this up? Is this a form-based or visual-based experiment or something else?


## Resolution




1. To insert a new iframe into the experiences, create an activity using Visual Experience Composer and insert iframe content.
2. To change the content inside an iframe, ensure that the iframe is under the same domain. Then in the custom code section, you need to insert code to change the content.




<b>Note:</b> Changing content in the third-party domain is not possible.
