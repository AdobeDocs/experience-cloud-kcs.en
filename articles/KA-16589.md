# Can we insert an iframe as an offer in Target experience?

## Description


Is it possible to set up an A/B-testÂ based on an adobe audience segment that control an iframe?



Example: Variant A contains one iframe content. Variant B contains another iframe content.

If possible, how do you set this up? Is this a form based or visual based experiment or something else?


## Resolution


1. If you want to insert a new iframe into the experiences, You can create an activity using Visual Experience Composer, and insert iframe content.

2. If you want to change the content inside an iframe, the iframe should be under the same domain, and in the custom code section, you need to insert code to change the content.



Note: Changing content in third party domain is not possible.
