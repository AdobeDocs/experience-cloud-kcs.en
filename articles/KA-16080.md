# Campaign Classic: Convert DateTime to UTC

## Description


It has been reported that problems were faced when trying to add a datetime in CRM database as the servers are on different time zones.

UTC date was attempted but could not be added.

The Adobe Campaign documentation was reviewed for a function such as "LocalToUTC" but this function isn't available.
 https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/campaign-standard/using/managing-processes-and-data/filtering-data/list-of-functions.html


## Resolution


The solution for this is to follow the instructions below:

<u><b>https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/campaign-classic/using/getting-started/connectors/crm-connectors.html </b></u>

The above specifies the way to connect the CRM to ACC.

There are 4 ways to transfer the column from CRM to ACC :

1.<b> Default </b>

2.<b> Date only</b> : this mode deletes Date + Time type fields.

3.<b>Without time offse</b>t : this mode cancels the time zone management applied in the default mode.

4.<b>Copy/Paste</b> : this mode uses raw data such as strings (no conversion). All the above are given in detail. The copy/paste command can be used while transferring the mentioned column and the add/subtract the time difference according to the time zone in CRM and. UTC

In the CRM table calculate the difference between the time zone entries in CRM and the UTC . Then after using the copy /paste command in ACC time can be added/subtracted according to UTC.
