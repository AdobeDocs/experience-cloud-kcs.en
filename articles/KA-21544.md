# No Audience Size in Microsoft Bing AEP Destination

## Description {#description}

Why does Bing not show any audience size for the AEP segments sent to the AEP Bing Destination?

## Resolution {#resolution}


The three most common reasons an AEP Bing destination does not result in any audience size are

- The Bing Ads CID is incorrect
- The ID sync was not enabled
- The ID sync isn't firing on the website


The [documentation for this integration](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/catalog/advertising/bing.html?lang=en) calls out that what you need to configure this destination is the Bing Ads CID. This is an <u>integer</u> and <b>will not </b>contain any letters. This piece of [Bing documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/advertising/guides/get-started?view=bingads-13) will help you find the CID. The "Get Your Account and Customer IDs" is the section that will help you determine what your CID is versus the account ID. Unfortunately, the Bing API does not respond with any error to indicate that the wrong ID was used. Hits are still sent to and accepted by Bing, even if the ID is incorrect. If you are an AAM customer with the AAM version of this destination in place (and it is working), then this would be the same Bing Ads CID used in the Audience Manager destination.

The second reason listed would only be applicable to those customers who didn't already have an AAM version of this destination configured and working. The same [configuration document](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/catalog/advertising/bing.html?lang=en) also calls out the need to have the ID sync if you didn't already have it setup for AAM to begin with. Create a support case to have this ID sync enabled if you have not already done so.

Lastly, even if the ID sync was enabled, it needs to fire on the website in question. Using an incognito browser to mimic the first page of a first visit, visit the website in question and use your browser's developer tools to ensure you see a call made to this URL:

https://c.bing.com/c.gif?uid=%DID%&Red3=MSAdobe_pd&gdpr=%GDPR_APPLIES%&gdpr_consent=%GDPR_CONSENT% (the %'s will be replaced actual values)

If you don't see that network call fire, then the Id sync is not happening. For Experience Cloud ID Service users, this could mean that I[D Syncs were disabled](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/id-service/using/id-service-api/configurations/disableidsync.html?lang=en). For WebSDK users, this would probably mean the 3rd party ID syncs were not enabled. To enable them, see this [article](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-cloud-kcs/kbarticles/KA-20248.html?lang=en).
