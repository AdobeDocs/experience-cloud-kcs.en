<b>Steps to Reproduce:</b>
 1: Navigate to Tools - Cloud Services.
 2: Click on Dynamic Media Configuration.
 3: Try to connect to Dynamic Media.


## Resolution


We need to remove the below bundles from the system/console if present

1. jaxb annotations v2.9.8
2. jaxb api v2.3.1


After removing the above bundles, AEM should be left with just these bundles -

1. jaxb runtime v2.3.2.2
2. jaxb-api-2.3 v2.3.0.3


Following the above steps, perform a restart of the setup. And you should be able to create Dynamic Media Configurations.
