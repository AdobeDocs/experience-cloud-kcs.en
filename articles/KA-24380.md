# Non-Admin Groups are not able to view the Custom Search Rail In AEM


This article explains how to enable non-admin groups to see the custom search rail in Adobe Experience Manager. In order to give users access to all facets, you will need read access to `/conf/global/settings/dam/search/facets`.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Experience Manager

### Issue/Symptoms

When a non-admin uses the Assets Admin Search Rail (navigated under <b>Assets</b> `>` <b> Files </b>`>` <b> Filter</b>), they do not see the same search rail that admin users do, especially if the search rail has been customized.

The non-admin users will see different fields in their admin console than the ones that admins would generally see.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The display of the correct search rail is dependent on access to the correct search facet. In order to give users access to all facets, read access to this file is required: `/conf/global/settings/dam/search/facets`.
