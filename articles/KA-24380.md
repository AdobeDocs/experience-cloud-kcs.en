# Some Non-Admin Groups Not Seeing Custom Search Rail In AEM

## Description {#description}


It is sometimes seen that when a non-Admin uses the Assets Admin Search Rail (ie. they go to Assets `>`  Files `>`  Filter), they do not see the same search rail that admin users do, especially if the search rail has been customized.The non-admin users will see different fields in their admin console than the ones that admins would see.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The display of the correct search rail is dependent on the access to the correct search facet. In order to give users access to all facets, they will need read access to /conf/global/settings/dam/search/facets.
