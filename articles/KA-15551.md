# Latency of data in Analytics for Analytics-Campaign integration

## Description


Why there could be latency in data in Analytics for integration between Adobe Analytics and Adobe Campaign?


## Resolution


Adobe Campaign uses Analytics Data Sources APIs to upload data to Analytics. When Analytics is integrated with Campaign, a Data Source account is automatically created. Campaign uploads data to Analytics servers after every 15 minutes via the APIs.

Note that the Campaign uploads the data with the date information. The data does not have a time stamp. Data Sources (in the absence of timestamps) process the data at 12 PM every day.

For example, data is uploaded at 4 PM today. As there is no timestamp in the data, Data Sources will not process the file until 12 PM the next day. Add 45 minutes of general latency and the data should be available after 12:24 PM the next day.
