# Why there is a latency of data in Analytics when using Campaign Data Connectors?

## Description


When using an integration between Adobe Analytics and Adobe Campaign, data in Analytics has a latency up to 20 hours.  This is a general concern from customers as Campaign uploads data to Analytics after every 15 minutes.


## Resolution


Campaign uses Analytics Data Sources APIs to upload data to Analytics. The integration creates a Data Source account automatically in the target report suite. Campaign uploads data to Analytics servers every 15 minutes via the APIs.

Campaign uploads the data with date information only. The data does not have the time stamp. Analytics Data Sources, in the absence of time stamps, process the data at 12 PM everyday.

Suppose, data is uploaded at 4 PM today. Since, there is no time stamp in the data, Data Sources will not process the file until 12 PM next day. The next day at 12 PM the data is processed. Add 45 minutes of general latency and the data should be available after 12:24 PM. So, it took about 23 hours to show the data, which is expected.

There is a feature request raised with the Campaign Engineering team to add timestamp in the data uploaded to Analytics. That should resolve the issue. Currently, there no ETA on this.
