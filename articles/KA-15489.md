# AEM: OOTB bundle version is lower than expected

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Experience Manager

<b>Issue</b>
 At <b>OSGi Console</b><b>OSGi</b><b>Bundles</b>, there is a bundle whose version is lower than that is expected for the installed SP/CFP.

This issue would not come as a solo issue. Usually something critical happens (for example: AEM login failing) and investigation reveals this as an intermediate cause.

<b>Cause</b>
 It is possible the bundle update failed at SP/CFP installation.

Another possible cause of the update failure is, that someone started AEM as a root user before and later started as the regular user.

During running as root user, `crx-quickstart/launchpad/felix/bundleXX` was owned by root.

At the time of SP/CFP installation, AEM, which is running as the regular user, cannot write under `bundleXX`, then the bundle update fails.


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>

Check the file/directory owner under `crx-quickstart`.

If the file/directory is not owned by the regular user for the AEM process, perform the following steps:

1. Stop AEM.
2. Change the owner back to the regular user.
3. Start AEM.
4. Reinstall the SP/CFP.
