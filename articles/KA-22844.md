# Registration token isn't stored in nms:appSubscriptionRcp table


Learn about a solution to when the registration token is not getting stored in the `nms:appSubscriptionRcp` table when receiving real-time push notifications in Adobe Campaign Classic.

## Description {#description}




### Environment
<br>Adobe Campaign Classic<br><br>


### Issue
<br>When receiving the real-time push notifications, the registration token is not getting stored in the `nms:appSubscriptionRcp` table.<br><br>



## Resolution {#resolution}


If the templates are transactional messages, then the token is provided as part of the payload from the third-party solution, and the token is stored in the `nms:eventHisto` entity in the field `@registrationToken`.

 The field is not visible in the detail view of the event, but you can bring the field in the <b>List</b> view using the <b>Configure List</b> option (Right-click in the list view, select <b>Configure List</b>, and then select `@registrationToken` field.).

The delivery logs are stored in the `nms:broadlogEventHisto` entity.
