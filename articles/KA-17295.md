# Hotclicks reports cannot generate a cumulative report against a recurring delivery

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign Standard



<b>Issues/Symptoms</b>
It has been asked whether or not the hotclicks report in ACS can run a cumulative report against all deliveries that roll up under a single recurring delivery.


## Resolution


Currently this is not possible and all hotclicks reports can only be run against the individual delivery which is generated off of the original delivery template. An enhancement `(CAMP-49569)` has been created to address this in a future release.
