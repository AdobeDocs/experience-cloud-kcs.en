# Three Assets Published when a Folder from DAM is Published


When a folder is selected in DAM for publishing all contained assets, only three assets are published excluding the others. It is advised to activate the assets one by one.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

When a folder is selected for publishing, only three assets are published, excluding the others.

<b>Steps to reproduce the issue:</b>

1. Select a folder in DAM which contains four or more images.
2. Click on <b>Manage publication</b> and then publish it.



## Resolution {#resolution}


As per internal JIRA of: #ASSETS-7803 - DMS7 - Upon Activation Settings.

It's working as designed. When publishing a folder to AEM, only the empty folder gets published. The anomaly observed with three assets is likely because those three must have been used as the folder thumbnail. Moving forward, activate assets individually.
