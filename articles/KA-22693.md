# Error when selecting Adobe Target as Cloud solution for IMS configuration

## Description {#description}


### Environment

AEM on-premises

### Issue/Symptoms

Error while creating an Adobe Target IMS configuration in order to integrate AEM with Adobe Target.  However, whenever *Adobe Target* is selected as the Cloud solution for the IMS configuration, the error "`Cannot retrieve certificates: The Provided userId does not identify an existing user"` pops up, and the configuration cannot be created. This issue is only happening for the Adobe Target solution.



<b>Steps to reproduce:</b>

- Select <b>Tools</b> `>`  <b>Security</b> `>`  <b>IMS configs </b>`>`  <b>Create</b>.


- Select <b>Target</b> as the solution.


An error will pop up: `"Cannot retrieve certificate. The provided userid does not identify an existing user."` In the logs the only error related to this issue is `[` 1`]` .

`[` 1`]`  `/libs/cq/adobeims-configuration/content/configurations/createimsconfig/contextCertificates HTTP/1.1]  com.adobe.cq.adobeims.impl.servlets.GetCertificatesServlet Cannot retrieve certificates: The provided userId does not identify an existing user.}` `[` 1`]`  Path: `/home/users/system/target-imsconfig-service` Permission: allow Privileges: jcr:read; rep:write


## Resolution {#resolution}


After adding the ACEs `[` 1`]`  to the user, the IMS configuration for Adobe Target could be successfully created.
<br>Cause<br>
The error is caused by a lack of permissions for the `target-imsconfig-service` user. When checking the permissions for the users' `target-imsconfig-service` and `targetservice,` it was noticed that `target-imsconfig-service` had no ACEs assigned.
