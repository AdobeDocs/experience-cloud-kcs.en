# Timezone is not correct for Google BigQuery schema


In Adobe Campaign Classic v8.5, when reading data from the column of a <b>Google BigQuery</b> table defined as `datetimetz` at the schema level, if the displayed date and hour do not include the operator's timezone information, add the option `useTimestampTZ` and set it to *1.*

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Campaign Classic v8.5



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

When reading data from a <b>Google BigQuery</b> table defined as `datetimetz` at the schema level, the displayed date and hour do not include the operator's timezone information.
<br> <br><br>
<b>Steps to reproduce:</b>

1. Define a new schema with <b>Google BigQuery</b> as the source of data.


2. Define a new attribute with the type `datetimetz`.


3. Read data from this schema in a workflow.


4. Check the output of the date field previously defined; one can see that the timezone of the operator is not taken into account.



## Resolution {#resolution}


To resolve this, add the option `useTimestampTZ`with value as *1* under the <b>Google BigQuery</b> external account that is being used when creating the schema.

Please note that the web server needs to be restarted for this change to take effect.

### <b>Cause:</b>

The `useTimestampTZ` option is missing in the external account definition.
