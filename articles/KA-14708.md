# Adobe Campaign: Queries against tsEvent take a long time

## Description {#description}


### Environment

- Campaign Classic
- Campaign
- Campaign Standard




### Issue/Symptoms

When creating queries against the tsEvent field on the nmsBroadLogRcp table in Classic and Standard versions of Adobe Campaign, queries take a long time to return or timeout.


## Resolution {#resolution}


This is because there is no index on the tsEvent table out of the box. An enhancement (CAMP-37074) has been created to include an index in the out-of-the-box code moving forward.

In the meantime, it is recommended to either not query large subsets of data using the tsEvent field or manually add an index on the tsEvent field.
