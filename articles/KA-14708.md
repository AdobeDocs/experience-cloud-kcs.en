# Adobe Campaign: Queries against tsEvent take a long time

## Description

It has been reported that within Classic and Standard versions of Adobe Campaign, when creating queries against the tsEvent field on the nmsBroadLogRcp table that the queries take a very long time to return or timeout.

## Resolution

The reason for this is that out of the box there is no index on the tsEvent table.Â  An enhancement (CAMP-37074) has been created to include an index in the out of the box code moving forward.

In the meantime it is recommended to either not query large subsets of data using the tsEvent field or to manually add an index on the tsEvent field.
