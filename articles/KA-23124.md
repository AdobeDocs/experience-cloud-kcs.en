# Control panel doesn't display all non-out of the box tables and running workflows


This article discusses why the Campaign control panel doesn't display all the non-out of the box tables and running workflows.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Classic (ACC) v8

### Issue/Symptoms

In the control panel, when accessing <b>Performance Monitoring</b> `>`  <b>Databases</b>:

- The *storage overview*section displays only a couple of custom (non-out of the box) tables, however, you have more than what is displayed.
- The<b>* </b>Top 10 temporary resources* section displays only a couple of workflows, while there are more workflows running on the instance than what is displayed.


#### Steps to reproduce

1. Go to the control panel; navigate to <b>Performance Monitoring </b>`>` <b> Databases</b>.
2. Check the *storage overview* and the *Top 10 temporary resources* sections and compare with what is actually present on the instance. You'll see that the numbers don't match.



## Resolution {#resolution}


An enhancement request has been logged with the control panel team.

You should discuss with the Technical Account Manager about the possibilities to monitor workflows/schemas that do not starting with *wkf/cus*.

### Cause

- The *Top 10 temporary resources* section displays only workflows that start with *wkf*.
- Non-out of the box table name should start with "*cus* to be displayed".
