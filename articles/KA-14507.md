# Changes made through the API not reflecting on Target

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Target

<b>Issue</b>
 While evaluating Target Admin API features, do not see the results reflected in the Target interface.

Examples:

<b>Scenario 1</b>
 Update Activity name

1. Send `PUT` request to `/{tenant}/target/activities/{id}/name`.
2. Response in Postman shows successful execution.
3. Also, you see updated Name "API Test Activity CHANGED" by sending `GET`: `/{tenant}/target/activities`.
4. But in Target you still see the old name "API Test Activity", although the changelog shows that activity was updated at the time of Postman request.


<b>Scenario 2</b>
 Update Offer by ID

1. Send `PUT` request to `/{tenant}/target/offers/content/{id}`.
2. Response in Postman shows successful execution.
3. But in Target you still see the old code, and offer info does not show date of Postman request.







## Resolution


<b>Solutions</b>

For activities that are created on UI and updated via API, then activity name is not reflected on UI. All other fields in activity are updated in UI.

For offers that are created on UI and updated via API, none of the fields are reflected on UI. Support for offer update via API created from UI is not yet available.

For resources (activities/audiences/offers/) created outside Target UI have no such restriction.
