# HTTP Trace method contains instance information

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
Experience Manager


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
A pentest was performed and the following medium risk was found: *Unnecessary HTTP method TRACE enabled*.

 The site was requested with the domain header, but the HTTP response contains information about the server's name. This allows attackers to see original host name and AEM instance name. The response header is coming from load balancers. Is it possible to mask the X-Original-Host in the HTTP responses?


## Resolution {#resolution}


The solution is to set <b>TraceEnable </b>off to each enabled *vhost* as per below:

...
VirtualHost \*:80
ServerName"customer-publish"
ServerAlias "customer.com"
TraceEnable off
...
/VirtualHost
