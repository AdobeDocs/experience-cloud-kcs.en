# The incoming links don't show all linking pages in Adobe Experience Manager


If a node with a link is located deeper than four levels from its page's jcr:content, the page will not show in the incoming links of the link target in Adobe Experience Manager. Read this article to learn why this happens.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service
- Adobe Experience Manager 6.5




### <b>Issues/Symptoms</b>

If a node with a link is located deeper than four levels from its page's jcr:content, the page will not be shown in the incoming links of the link target.

• When a linking page is shown in the incoming links:
   /content/wknd/us/en/link-page/jcr:content
   1) /root
   2) /container
   3) /container
   4) /text(link)

• When a linking page is not shown in the incoming links:
   /content/wknd/us/en/link-page/jcr:content
   1) /root
   2) /container
   3) /container
   4) /container
   5) /text(link)


## Resolution {#resolution}


Check the hierarchy of nodes that contain the link using CRXDE Lite.

Review the structure of the page and adjust it so that the link node can be located at a shallow level.
If the level of the linking node remains at a deep level adjust an index to increase the level to be indexed for the incoming links searching.

Using CRX/DE Lite, select


```
/oak:index/cqPageLucene/aggregates/cq:PageContent.
```

 Create a new node and add a 'path' property that expresses the required hierarchy level.
- In the following example, 'include4' and 'include5' are added to increase the level of incoming links searching up to 6.

To perform reindex, change the value of reindex property of `/oak:index/cqPageLucene` to true and save it.

    - Once the reindexing completes, the following message appears in error.log.

`    13.01.2023 12:00:45.264 *INFO* [ async-index-update-async]  org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.plugins.index.AsyncIndexUpdate [ async]  Reindexing completed for indexes: [ /oak:index/cqPageLucene*(788)]  in 733.7 ms (733 ms)`

Reindexing may cause a performance issue.
    It is recommended to schedule the reindex task for a relatively quiet time.
