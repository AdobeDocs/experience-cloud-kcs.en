# Intermittent slowness on AEM Cloud


In this knowledge base article, we explore the recommended approach for handling launches within Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). While AEM does not currently support the automatic deletion of launches, understanding how to manage them manually is crucial for ensuring a clean and efficient authoring environment.

## Description {#description}






AEM users frequently work with launches for staging content changes, translations etc. Over time, these launches can accumulate, potentially affecting the performance and manageability of the AEM instance. It is important for users to know how to manage these launches effectively to prevent clutter and maintain system health








## Resolution {#resolution}


To manage and delete unnecessary launches, users should:

- Regularly review the Launches console for any outdated or unnecessary launches.
- Manually select and delete launches that are no longer needed directly from the Launches console in the AEM UI.
- Consider linking the deletion of launches to the completion of associated projects or translation workflows, where applicable.
- Stay informed about potential future enhancements to AEM that may introduce the capability for automatic launch deletion.


By following these steps, AEM users can ensure their instances remain streamlined and performant. This article also references the related JIRA ticketÂ <b>SITES-12993</b>, which is under consideration for future product development.
