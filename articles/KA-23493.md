# Access to SFTP folders /usr/local/neolane/nl6 or /usr/local/neolane/nl6/var/


If you need to access SFTP folders `/usr/local/neolane/nl6` or `/usr/local/neolane/nl6/var/` in Adobe Campaign Classic, please open a support case. Our Customer Support team will then open a Jira with Tech Ops to request SFTP usage.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Campaign Classic



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

How to access Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) folders - `/usr/local/neolane/nl6` or `/usr/local/neolane/nl6/var/` in Adobe Campaign Classic?


## Resolution {#resolution}


We do not grant access to users to the SFTP folders `/usr/local/neolane/nl6` or `/usr/local/neolane/nl6/var/` for security reasons as these are application folders.

To obtain information about the files in these folders, you should raise a support ticket. The Customer Support team will then create a Jira request with Tech Ops to enable SFTP usage and extract the data from the folders.
