# Download Job button in Privacy UI

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Analytics

<b>Issue</b>
 Why is it that for some jobs theÂ <b>Download Job</b> button is available in privacy UI, but for some it isn't, although both are successfully completed?


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>
The<b> Download Job</b> button is only available for "Access" type jobs where an attachment is associated with the some data you would like to access.

It is not available for "Delete" type of jobs.

If a "Delete" type job is set with status *Completed*, that means the requested data has been deleted.
