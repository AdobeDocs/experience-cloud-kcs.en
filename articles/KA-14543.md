# Download Job button in Privacy UI

## Description


Question- Why is it that for some jobs "Download Job" button is available in privacy UI but but for some it isn't although both are successfully completed?


## Resolution


Download button is only available for "Access" type jobs where an attachment is associated with the some data you would like to access. It is not available for "Delete" type of jobs. If  a "Delete" type job is set with status "Completed" means the requested data has been deleted.
