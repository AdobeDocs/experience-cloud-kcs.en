# Download Job button in Privacy UI

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Analytics

<b>Issue</b>
 Why is it that for some jobs theÂ <b>Download Job</b> button is available in privacy UI, but for some it isn't, although both are successfully completed?


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>
The<b> Download Job</b> button is only available for "[!UICONTROL Access]" type jobs where an attachment is associated with the some data you would like to access.

It is not available for "[!UICONTROL Delete]" type of jobs.

If a "[!UICONTROL Delete]" type job is set with status *[!UICONTROL Completed]*, that means the requested data has been deleted.
