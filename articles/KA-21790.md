# Not allowed to delete due to segment sharing enabled error in AAM

## Description {#description}


These steps will help resolve the following error: "Not allowed to delete due to segment sharing enabled"Â 

 This error occurs when trying to delete a trait or segment in AAM. The reason for this error is because the trait or segment is shared from Audience Manager to AEP.


## Resolution {#resolution}


1. Navigate to the Sources tab in AEP, and open the settings for your Audience Manager source connector:

3. Once the segments or traits are unchecked, click Next in the upper right corner. On the resulting page, review your changes and click Finished.

If you are sharing all segments and traits from AAM - AEP , you'll need to update your configuration to share specific segments, or stop sharing data in order to delete your AAM segment.
