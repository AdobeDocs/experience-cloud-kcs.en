# How to stop issuing "s_sq" cookies

## Description

I would like to stop the "s_sq" cookie from being issued, but I don't know how to do that.

## Resolution


The "s_sq" cookie is a cookie that stores data about where and what visitors click on in Adobe Analytics' Activity Map feature.

To stop this cookie from being issued, change the following ClickMap settings.

Uncheck "Enable ClickMap" if you have enabled ClickMap in the LINK TRACKING setting of the Adobe Analytics extension in the Adobe Experience Platform tag.

If you have enabled ClickMap by setting "s.trackInlineStats=true" in the custom code of your Adobe Analytics extension, change it to "s.trackInlineStats=false".
