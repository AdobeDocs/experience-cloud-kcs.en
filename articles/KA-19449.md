# How to stop issuing "s_sq" cookies

## Description

I would like to stop the "s_sq" cookie from being issued, but I don't know how to do that.

## Resolution


First, if "s.trackInlineStats=true" is written in the Adobe Analytics Extension custom code, change it to "false" to prevent the cookie from being issued. Secondly, uncheck "Enable ClickMap" in the LINK TRACKING setting of the Adobe Analytics Extension on Adobe Experience Platform Tags.
