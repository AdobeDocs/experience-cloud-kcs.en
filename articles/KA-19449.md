How can one stop the `s_sq` cookie from being issued?


## Resolution {#resolution}


The `s_sq` cookie is a cookie that stores data about where and what visitors click on in Adobe Analytics' Activity Map feature.

To stop this cookie from being issued, change the following ClickMap settings:

- Uncheck "Enable ClickMap" if you have enabled ClickMap in the LINK TRACKING setting of the Adobe Analytics extension in the Adobe Experience Platform tag.

- If you have enabled ClickMap by setting `s.trackInlineStats=true` in the custom code of your Adobe Analytics extension, change it to `s.trackInlineStats=false`.
