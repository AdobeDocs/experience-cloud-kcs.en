# How to setup AAM API access

## Description


This article outlines how to create a project in the [!DNL developer] console to generate [!DNL Audience Manager] API JWT credentials.


## Resolution


You'll need system administrator permissions in the [!DNL Admin Console] in order to generate credentials for the Audience Manager API. Steps 1 & 2 outline how to grant these escalated permissions. Your current system administrators may prefer to follow these steps themselves rather than granting escalated admin permissions to an additional user, in which case skip directly to step 3.

1) Navigate to the [Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/) , and select "Add Admins" from the "Quick Links" menu:

2) Enter the emails for all users you would like to grant access. On the next page, select "System Administrator" for the permission level:

3) Navigate to [https://developer.adobe.com/console](https://developer.adobe.com/console) . If you don't have access yet despite being granted system admin rights in the previous steps, try refreshing your cookies/cache.

4) Create a new project from the [!UICONTROL quick start] menu (or the [!UICONTROL projects] menu in the top nav):

5) Add the [!DNL Audience Manager] API to your project:

6) Follow the steps to generate (or upload) your JWT credentials. If you choose to generate the credentials via the dev console, be sure to securely store the private key. The automatically downloaded config folder is the only copy of your private key.

7) Next, you'll be prompted to assign the credentials to relevant product profiles. If your organization utilizes role-based access controls, you'll need to follow these steps to create a technical user account & add that account to the relevant RBAC group: [https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/api-and-sdk-code/rest-apis/aam-api-getting-started.html?lang=en#technical-account-rbac-permissions](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/api-and-sdk-code/rest-apis/aam-api-getting-started.html?lang=en#technical-account-rbac-permissions)

8) Once these steps are complete, you can follow this documentation to utilize the JWT credentials to request an access token for direct use with the API: [https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/authentication/JWT/#exchanging-jwt-to-retrieve-an-access-token](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/authentication/JWT/#exchanging-jwt-to-retrieve-an-access-token)

Finally, you can utilize API calls by passing the access token retrieved in step 8 in the [!UICONTROL x-api-key] field outlined in the API docs: [[!DNL https]://bank.demdex.com/portal/swagger/index.html#/Segments%20API/get_segments_](https://bank.demdex.com/portal/swagger/index.html#/Segments%20API/get_segments_)
