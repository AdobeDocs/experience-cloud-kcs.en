# Unable to modify Profile Merge Rule using BAAAM tool and UI

## Description

While trying to edit profile merge from A to B for my segments in UI and via BAAAM,  I am ending up in errors indicating a Data Export Control rule is blocking the update.
<br> 

## Resolution


This issue occurs due to discrepancy in the Data export Label of Profile Merge Rules & Data export label of Datasource/Destination.

We can control if the Profile Merge Rule allows PII/on-site or off-site targeting etc. Similarly, destinations and datasources have their own set of data Export controls.

To be able to successfully share the data/create segments, all these data export controls must align

Due to miss match in Data export labels between PMR & Destinations/Datasource you might see such issues.
