# Unable to modify Profile Merge Rule using BAAAM tool and UI


Learn how to resolve the Adobe Audience Manager issue while editing profile merge from A to B for segments in UI and via BAAAM.

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Audience Manager

<b>Issue</b>
 While trying to edit profile merge from A to B for segments in UI and via BAAAM, errors occur indicating a Data Export Control rule is blocking the update.


## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Solution</b>
This issue occurs due to discrepancy in the Data export Label of Profile Merge Rules and Data export label of Datasource/Destination.

You can control if the Profile Merge Rule allows PII/on-site or off-site targeting, etc.

Similarly destinations and datasources have their own set of data Export controls.

To be able to successfully share the data/create segments, all these data export controls must align.

Due to mismatch in Data export labels between PMR & Destinations/Datasource, such issues might occur.
