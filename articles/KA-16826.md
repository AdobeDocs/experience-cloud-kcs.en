# Counter Variable in XPath name?

## Description {#description}


### Environment

- Campaign Classic
- Campaign
- Campaign Standard


### Issue/Symptoms

Is it possible to use a counter variable like the one given below in an xpath name?


```
<set expr=”@counter” xpath=”/test/element[ @counter] ”>
```

<br>Trying this shows an error with the @counter in the bracket in the xpath, but using a number instead `<set expr=”@counter” xpath=”/test/element[ 1] ”>` works just fine.<br>Is there a function for adding to a `DOMDocument` Element, either by an append function or by using the above-mentioned counter variables?

## Resolution {#resolution}


xpathExpr will work.
