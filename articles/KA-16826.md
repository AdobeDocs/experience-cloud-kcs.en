# Counter Variable in XPath name?

## Description


Environment

- Campaign Classic
- Campaign
- Campaign Standard




Is it possible to use a counter variable like the one given below in an xpath name?


```
set expr=”@counter” xpath=”/test/element@counter”

 
Trying this shows an error with the @counter in the bracket in the xpath, but using a number instead set expr=”@counter” xpath=”/test/element1” works just fine.
 
Is there a function for adding to a DOMDocument Element, either by an append function or by using the above mentioned counter variables?
```





## Resolution


xpathExpr will work.
