# Counter Variable in XPath name?

## Description


Do you know whether we can use a counter variable in an xpath name? Something like this?
  
 set expr=”@counter” xpath=”/test/element@counter”
  
 I have tried this, but I get an error with the @counter in the bracket in the xpath, a number instead set expr=”@counter” xpath=”/test/element1” works just fine.
  
 Is there a function for adding to a DOMDocument Element, either by an append function or by using the above mentioned counter variables?


## Resolution


xpathExpr did the magic.
