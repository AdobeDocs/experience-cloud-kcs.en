# Adobe Campaign Standard: File Fails to upload if email entries contain "double"

## Description

It has been reported that when attempting to load a .csv using the File Load activity that the file fails to upload.  Upon investigation this was found to be because within the .csv the first column was the email column and some emails contained "double" within the address.  It was found that there is a bug in [!DNL CentOS] 7 where if a line starts with double, etern, char, etc, the OS thinks that a reserved keyword is attempting to be used within the file and causes a failure to upload as the access is restricted.

## Resolution

Currently the resolution requires a fix from [!DNL CentOS].  With that said, the workaround is to either remove the entries with "double" in them or to add a blank column to the front of the .csv file.
