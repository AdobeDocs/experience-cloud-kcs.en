# File Fails to upload if email entries contain "double"

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Campaign Standard



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

The file fails to upload when loading a .csv using the File Load activity.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Currently, the resolution requires a fix from *CentOS*. A workaround is to remove the entries with *double* in them or add a blank column to the front of the .csv file.


<b>Cause</b>
It is because within the .csv, the first column was the email column and some emails contained *double* within the address. It was found that there is a bug in *CentOS 7* where if a line starts with double, etern, char, etc., the OS thinks that a reserved keyword is attempting to be used within the file and causes a failure to upload as the access is restricted.
