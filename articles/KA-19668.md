# Adobe Analytics not ingesting any data even when the connector is set | AEP


After setting up the Analytics source connector, it has been observed that Adobe Analytics data is not being ingested into the Adobe Experience Platform. This is because there is no target dataset, which is preventing the dataflow from ingesting any data.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Adobe Experience Platform
- Adobe Analytics




### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

In this example, the Adobe Analytics data is not flowing in, even when the source connector has been set up.


## Resolution {#resolution}


After checking the dataflow configuration, it turns out it did not have a target dataset.Â The lack of a target dataset is the cause for the dataflow not ingesting any data.

When in Sources, go to the <b>Dataflows</b> tab and select the relevant dataflow. Then check for <b>Target Dataset</b> as shown below. If empty, you will have to re-create a new dataflow.
