# AEP - Adobe Analytics Data is not flowing in even when the connector is set

## Description


In this example, the Adobe Analytics data is not flowing in, even though the source connector has been set up.


## Resolution


After checking the dataflow configuration, it turns out it did not have a target dataset.Â The lack of a target dataset is the cause for the dataflow not ingesting any data.

When in Sources, simply go to the [!UICONTROL Dataflows] tab and select the relevant dataflow, check for 'Target Dataset' - see below:

If empty, you will have to re-create a new dataflow.
