# Adobe Analytics not ingesting any data even when the connector is set

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Platform

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

In this example, the Adobe Analytics data is not flowing in, even when the source connector has been set up.


## Resolution {#resolution}


After checking the dataflow configuration, it turns out it did not have a target dataset.Â The lack of a target dataset is the cause for the dataflow not ingesting any data.

When in Sources, simply go to the Dataflows tab and select the relevant dataflow. Then check for 'Target Dataset' as shown below. If empty, you will have to re-create a new dataflow.
