# Error in delivery analysis "content htmlContent' line 19: recipient is not defined"

## Description


If you experience the following error during the delivery execution for a recipient:

'content htmlContent' line 19: the recipient is not defined. SCR-160012 JavaScript: error while evaluating script 'content htmlContent'"


## Resolution


This happens when you use a target mapping in a delivery which is different than the incoming data in the delivery activity of a workflow. So suppose you queried recipeint table and passed it to a delivery, and in the delivery, you have a custom targetMapping, you will get this error.



Secondly, if you are using a custom target mapping in a delivery and it hasÂ any personalization block or any column referencing in its content, and you use the [!UICONTROL recipient] object, you will get this error. e.g. if you call [!UICONTROL recipient.id] or [!DNL recipient.email]
