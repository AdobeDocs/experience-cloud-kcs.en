# Request queue becomes unpublished


If you see that a request queue in Adobe Workfront becomes unpublished, you have to ensure that the <b>Publish as Help Request Queue</b> checkbox remains checked.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Workfront

### Issue/Symptoms

On attempting to submit a new request, the queue no longer appears as an option in the <b>Request Type</b> drop-down.

Upon further investigation by going to the request queue (project) and navigating to the <b>Queue Details</b> tab, you see that the <b>Publish as Help Request Queue</b> checkbox remains unchecked.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Click the <b>Publish as Help Request Queue</b> checkbox to ensure that it is published.

#### Steps to avoid the issue

1. When attaching a template to an already published request queue, click <b>Project Actions</b>.
2. Click <b>Attach Template</b> (refer to our Workfront guide below).
3. After choosing the template, click <b>Customize and attach</b> (refer to our Workfront guide below).
4. In the <b>Options</b> section, uncheck <b>Queue Properties & Request Setup </b>(this ensures that the <b>Queue Details</b> settings are not overwritten).
5. Click <b>Attach Template</b>.


### Cause

When you attach a template to the project queue, the <b>Queue Details</b> settings from the template will overwrite the <b>Queue Details</b> settings in the queue. As a result, the queue could become unpublished.
