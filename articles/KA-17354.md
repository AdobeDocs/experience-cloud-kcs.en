# Lift values disappeared from Target UI

## Description


<b>Issue :</b> I was able to view the lift values in Target UI, but they are not available now when checking for the same date range


## Resolution




<b>Fact :</b> The UI does not display the lift for experience with Confidence 0



<b>Explanation : </b>when the UI was showing the lift, the value of the confidence was 0. However later in the day with more visitors the confidence  reduced to 0
