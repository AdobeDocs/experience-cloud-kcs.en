# ACS: Random characters appear in column definitions on file upload

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Campaign Standard

<b>Issue</b>
 When a file is uploaded on the Load File activity, when you refresh to detect a new column, extra characters appear with the "Email" header.
 This can also be seen in Column Definition.
 The ID will result with an i_Email instead of Email.

<u>Steps to reproduce the issue</u>:

1. Use a <b>workflow</b><b>Load activity</b>.
 Have a CSV file with at least one column with a header, (Example: "Email")
 2. Select the file within the Load activity to import the file.
 3. Go to the <b>File Structure</b> tab after a successful import.

<u>Expected Results</u>:

No extra characters appear with the "Email" header.
 Column Definition is normal.
 The ID will result with "Email".

<u>Actual Results</u>:

Extra characters appear with the "Email" header.
 This can also be seen in Column Definition.
 The ID will result with an "i_Email" instead of "Email".

## Resolution


<b>Cause</b>
The issue is related to the file encoding.

When files are saved with the UTF-8-BOM encoding, the BOM characters (EF BB BF)Â are added at the beginning of the file.
