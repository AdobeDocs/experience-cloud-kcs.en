# ACS -  Random characters appear in column definitions ( Label or ID ) when a file is uploaded in Load activity

## Description


<b>Use case</b> - A client has reported an issue when a file is uploaded on the Load File activity.

Here are steps are taken to reproduce the issue:

1. Use a workflow--Load activity.
 Have a CSV file with at least one column with a header, let's say: "Email."
 2. Select the file within the Load activity to import the file.
 3. Go to the FILE STRUCTURE tab after a successful import.

When you refresh to detect a new column, you will see extra characters with the "Email" header.
 This can also be seen in COLUMN DEFINITION.

You will also see ID has an i_Email instead of Email.

## Resolution


The issue is related to the file encoding. When files are saved with the UTF-8-BOM encoding, the BOM characters (EF BB BF)Â are added at the beginning of the file.
