Recommendations Activities created using the Visual composer does not sync. Error consistent across multiple users.

Steps to Reproduce:
                1) Create recommendations activity and select visual composer
                2) Proceed through set up, we clicked a page element and used "replace with recommendations"
                3) Use the criteria and designs
                4) Set any traffic allocation
                5) Save Activity
                Notice: Does not sync.
Note: Form based composer recommendations work flow works fine.

A setting needs to be enabled on [!DNL Target] Classic-Client Details page to support "Visual recommendation offer"

After this setting is enabled, we should be able to sync the Recommendations VEC activties successfully.
