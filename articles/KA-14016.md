# Target Recommendations' Visual Composer workflow error

## Description


Recommendations Activities created using the Visual Composer do not sync. Error is consistent across multiple users.

<b>Steps to reproduce:</b>

1. Create Recommendations Activity and select the <b>Visual Composer</b>.
2. Proceed through set up, click a page element, and select <b>Replace with Recommendations.</b>
3. <b> </b>Use the criteria and designs.
4. Set any traffic allocation.
5. Save Activity.




Note that Recommendations Activities do not sync. Form-based composer recommendations workflow works fine.


## Resolution


- Enable the setting to support the Visual Recommendations offer in <b>Target Classic </b> <b>Client details page</b>.
- After the setting is enabled, the Recommendations VEC activities should sync successfully.
