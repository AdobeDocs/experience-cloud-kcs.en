# Campaign Classic: error enriching BigQuery data

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Classic v8.4.5



### Issue/Symptoms

You create a workflow that reads data from a BigQuery view and then add an enrichment activity to enrich the data with an ACC table. When you run the workflow, you see this error:  
`enrich3 ODB-240000 Erreur ODBC : [ Simba] [ DSI]  An error occurred while attempting to retrieve the error message for key 'GAuthFailStorageAPI' and component ID 100: Could not open error message files - Check that "/opt/google-bigquery/bigquery_odbc/lib/en-US/Simba`


## Resolution {#resolution}


Contact your Google BigQuery team to check the account permissions. For information about permissions and roles, refer to [BigQuery predefined IAM roles](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery) on cloud.google.com.

### <b>Cause</b>

Account permissions issue. Correct permissions need to be assigned to the service account, in order for these operations to run.
