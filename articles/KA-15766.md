<b>Solution</b>
Below are some steps that you can follow to resolve this error:

1. When you install, right-click the setup file and select <b>Run as Administrator</b>, just to make sure it tries to use full admin rights.

If above does not work, then try below approaches:

2. Clear the hard cache

Please follow the below steps to clear out the hard cache:

1. Close the console.
2. Open the folder `C:\Users\Windows Username\AppData\Roaming\Neolane\NL_5`.
3. Delete all the xml files except `nlclient_cnx.xml` and delete the `nlclient` sub-folder.
4. Then restart the console to if that is successful.


3. Remove a key in your computer's registry.

Use the windows registry editor (`regedit`) to remove the key `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Neolane`.

a. How to access this key:

1. In Start menu type `regedit` in the section <b>Search programs and files</b>.
2. A new window opens saying, "Do you want the following program to make changes to this computer" then say *Yes*.
3. <b>Registry Editor</b> opens in a new window.
4. Delete the following key: `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Neolane`.


b. Restart your computer, then reinstall Neolane.



Also, in the past all the issues related to this error were resolved by following the below mentioned steps:

1. Close the console.
2. Go to sub-step a. or b. depending on the OS you have on your local machine:

        a. XP: `C:\Documents and Settings\Application Data\Neolane\NL_5`   

        b. Windows 7/10: `C:\Users\Windows User Name\AppData\Roaming\Neolane\NL_5`
3. Delete all files and subfolders inside this folder except `nlclient_cnx.xml`. <b>Please ensure that you do not delete the file `nlclient_cnx.xml`.</b>
4. Check if you still face the error. If not, the problem is resolved. If you observe the problem again, please redo steps 1 through 3 and then continue with step 5.
5. Uninstall the client, delete the following registry entries below, then reboot and reinstall the client:

        a. `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\DirectDraw\MostRecentApplication`

        b. `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Neolane\NL_5\nlclient\Forms\`


This has many subfolders/entries relating to various forms and other items, so just delete the whole folder.
Note: If it's a 32-bit Windows, then ignore the `Wow6432Node\` subfolder, since it doesn't exist in 32-bit Windows.

<u><b>Note</b></u><b>:</b> It is important to make a registry backup or create system restore point before performing these tasks.
