# Registry error after installing new client console

## Description

<br>Many times, post upgrading the Windows version, we come across an error related to the registry key:
<br>Error text:

```
Unable to find HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Neolane|NL_5\nlclient\
```




<br> <br>

## Resolution

<b>Resolution:</b>


Below are some steps that one can follow to resolve this error:





- First Step once can try is, when you install, right click the setup file and select "Run as Administrator", just to make sure it tries to use full admin rights





If above does not work, then try below approaches:





CLEARING HARD CACHE:





Please follow below steps to clear out the hard cache :



a) Close the console

b) Open the folder "C:\Users\Windows Username\AppData\Roaming\Neolane\NL_5"

c) Delete all the xml files except nlclient_cnx.xml and delete the "nlclient" sub-folder





d) Then restart the console and see if that helps.







Another approach which might help you overcome this situation :





1. Using the windows registry editor (regedit) to remove the key Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Neolane.



Here is how to access to this key:



a) In Start menu type "regedit" in the section "Search programs and files".

b) A new window opens saying "Do you want the following program to make changes to this computer" then say 'Yes'.

c) "Registry Editor" opens in a new window.

d) Delete the following key: Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Neolane







2. Restart your computer, then reinstall Neolane







Also, in the past all the issues related to this error were resolved by following the below mentioned steps:





1. Close the console



2. Go to sub-step a or b depending on the OS you have on your local machine :



a) XP: C:\Documents and Settings\Application Data\Neolane\NL_5



b) Windows 7/10: C:\Users\Windows User Name\AppData\Roaming\Neolane\NL_5



3. delete all files and subfolders inside this folder except :  nlclient_cnx.xml. Please ensure that you do not delete the file nlclient_cnx.xml.



4. Check if you still face the error. If not, the problem is resolved. If you observe the problem again please redo steps 1 to 3 and then continue with step 5.



5. Uninstall the client, delete the following registry entries below, then reboot and reinstall the client.



a) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\DirectDraw\MostRecentApplication



b) HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Neolane\NL_5\nlclient\Forms\



This had a bunch of subfolders/entries relating to various forms and others stuff, so just delete the whole folder.



Note: If it's a 32bit Windows, then ignore the "Wow6432Node\" subfolder, it won't exist.







Note: It is important to take registry backup or create system restore point before performing such tasks
