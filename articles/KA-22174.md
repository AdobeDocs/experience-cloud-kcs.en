# Was the "Forward to a friend" designed to work with MID

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign Classic

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
The customer is trying to use the *Forward to a friend* option in a hybrid configuration with Mid Sourcing Instance (MID) hosted by Adobe. The problem they encountered is that after the first recipient clicks on the envelope to share the email that they received, they insert the next recipient's (friend's) email address in the web form (web app called *viral*) and they click <b>Send</b>, the error says:

*The '#EMAIL#' sender email address is not authorized (deliverability configuration not carried out)*.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The feature didn't work on MID as there are not that many customers using it. We will remove this feature on V8.
