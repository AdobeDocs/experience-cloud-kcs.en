# Was the "Forward to a friend" designed to work with MID?

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Campaign Classic

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Using the *Forward to a friend* option in a hybrid configuration with Mid Sourcing Instance (MID) hosted by Adobe is throwing an error.

After the first recipient clicks on the envelope to forward the email that they have received, they insert the next recipient's (friend's) email address in the web form (web app called *viral*). The following error shows up when they click <b>Send</b>:

`The '#EMAIL#' sender email address is not authorized (deliverability configuration not carried out)`.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The feature didn't work on MID as there are not many customers using it. It is expected to be removed in Version 8.
