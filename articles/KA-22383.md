# Adding a WAF Configuration before Fastly CDN

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Experience Manager

### Issue/Symptoms

You may need to configure the embedded AEM as a Cloud Service Fastly CDN to point to a WAF provided by various third parties - eg. Imperva.

Adobe documentation <b>`[` 1`]` </b> talks about Bring Your Own CDN (BYO CDN) but in this case, you will use your own WAF but Adobe's CDN.

<b>`[` 1`]` </b> [Guide to Customer CDN points to AEM-Managed CDN](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/content-delivery/cdn.html#point-to-point-CDN)


## Resolution {#resolution}


In this particular scenario, you should use the same documentation provided by Adobe - <b>`[` 1`]` </b>.

BYOCDN from Adobe's point of view refers to any reverse proxy set in front of Fastly (even if it is not a CDN and it is a WAF). So a WAF in front of Fastly should be set up exactly like a CDN in front of Fastly. Fastly will still continue to do the caching.
