# Adding a WAF Configuration before Fastly CDN


In this particular scenario, you should use the same documentation provided by Adobe, [Guide to Customer CDN points to AEM-Managed CDN](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/content-delivery/cdn.html#point-to-point-CDN) in our AEM User Guide.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service (AEMaaCS)

### Issue

You may need to configure the embedded AEM as a Cloud Service Fastly CDN to point to a WAF provided by various third parties (For example: Imperva).

Adobe documentation's [Guide to Customer CDN points to AEM-Managed CDN](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/content-delivery/cdn.html#point-to-point-CDN) talks about Bring Your Own CDN (BYO CDN), but in this case, you will use your own WAF, but Adobe's CDN.


## Resolution {#resolution}


In this particular scenario, you should use the same documentation provided by Adobe, [Guide to Customer CDN points to AEM-Managed CDN](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/content-delivery/cdn.html#point-to-point-CDN) in our AEM User Guide.

BYOCDN from Adobe's point of view refers to any reverse-proxy set in front of Fastly (even if it isn't a CDN and it's a WAF). So a WAF in front of Fastly should be set up exactly like a CDN in front of Fastly. Fastly will still continue to do the caching.
