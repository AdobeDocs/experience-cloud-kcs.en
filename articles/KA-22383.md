# Adding a WAF Configuration before Fastly CDN

## Description {#description}

Customers may need to configure the embedded AEM as a Cloud Service Fastly CDN to pointing to a WAF provided by various third parties - eg. Imperva.<br><br><br>
Adobe documentation `[` 1`]`  talks about Bring Your Own CDN (BYO CDN) but in this case the customers will use their own WAF but Adobe's CDN.

## Resolution {#resolution}


In this particular scenario, the customers should use the same documentation provided by Adobe - `[` 1`]` .

BYOCDN from Adobe's point of view refers to any reverse proxy set in front of Fastly (even if it is not a CDN and it is a WAF). So a WAF in front of Fastly should be set up exactly like a CDN in front of Fastly. Fastly will still continue to do the caching.
