# Adobe Campaign Standard: Hide reports from user group

## Description {#description}


### Environment

- Adobe Campaign
- Adobe Campaign Standard


### Issue/Symptoms

Is it possible to hide all the reports for some users from the UI?


## Resolution {#resolution}


It's not possible to have specific functionalities for different users in Adobe Campaign Standard. The default access for standard users is an all-or-nothing approach.
