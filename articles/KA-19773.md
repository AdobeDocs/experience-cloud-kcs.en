<b>Environment</b>

- Adobe Analytics

- AppMeasurement for JavaScript

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Unable to override variable with an invalid value.Â  Here are example steps to reproduce this issue.

<b>Step 1. </b>Send `s.t()` call with value below.


```
eVar1: Old value

eVar2: Old value
```


<b>Step 2. </b>Send `s.t()` call with an override object.


```
var y = new Object();

y.eVar1 = "";

y.eVar2 = "New value";

s.t(y);
```


Notice that the following Analytics values will be sent. The value for `eVar1` is not overridden as the empty value
