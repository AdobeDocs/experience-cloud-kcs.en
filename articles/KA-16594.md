# Forms based Experience - "clicked an mbox" is not capturing visitors in reports

## Description


I have a forms experience setup on me homepage using the global mbox. I've setup click tracking but I'm not seeing the metrics aggregate in reporting. I have a backup metric that counts pageviews of the pages where the links go. So I know users are seeing these pages but the clicks aren't registering as I would expect. See below for more details.





I'm tracking clicks using the following script (there are five buttons across five image carousel slides).




```
// Adobe Target Tracking    document.querySelectorAll('li.glide__slide div.info a').forEach(link = {        link.addEventListener('click', event = {            adobe.target.trackEvent({                    "mbox": "July2020_CarouselTest",                    "params": {                    "ctaClick": link.getAttribute('href')                }            });        })    });
```




I can see the mbox request when I use Adobe Experience Platform Debugger and click one of the elements. See the screenshot below.

In my Target activity, I've created a a conversion metric targeting the mbox mentioned above. I have a refining audience requiring a value be present in the ctaClick parameter. See below for screenshots detailing this.

As a safeguard, I've added an additional metric without the refining audience. Metrics aren't aggregating in activity reporting for this metric either.

Finally, as a third backup, I've added the pageviews where the button clicks lead to as a metric. Activity reportingÂ <b>is showing pageviews to these pages</b>.



Why isn't activity reporting showing any conversions on my trackevent associated clicks?


## Resolution




To use the 'Clicked on mbox' method you need to wrap an mbox around the CTA and let the user actually click on it. I believe you should try 'Viewed an mbox' as you are firing the mbox after they click on it.
