# OOTB function nms.eventHisto.GetMirrorUrl doesn't return any URL or returns incorrect URL

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Campaign Classic v8



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

In a workflow with a JS activity, when calling the Out-of-the-box (OOTB) function `nms.eventHisto.GetMirrorUrl`, it doesn't return any URL or returns an incorrect URL.

<b>Steps to reproduce:</b>

1. Create a workflow with a JavaScript activity.


2. In the JavaScript activity, add the following code, replace *1234567* with an *event histo id* existing on your ACC marketing instance. Preview the event history to ensure that it has a working mirror URL.

    

    `logInfo('URL: ' + nms.eventHisto.GetMirrorUrl(1234567));`


3. Execute the workflow and check the logs:

    - Either no URL is returned




        - OR The URL returned doesn't match the URL displayed in the preview tab for the event you called the function on.



## Resolution {#resolution}

<b>Solution:</b>
Add quotes around the event *histo id* in the function call.
<br>The call should look like:
`logInfo('URL: ' + nms.eventHisto.GetMirrorUrl("1234567"));`

<b>Cause</b>
The function doesn't work because it is called with a long parameter.
