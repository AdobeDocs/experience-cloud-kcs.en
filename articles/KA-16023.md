# ACC AEP SDK Logon-Logoff

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign Classic
- Campaign



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
In general, we integrate the *AEP*or *Neolane SDK*to execute the `setPushIdenfitier` or `registerDevice` method to register the token in the campaign and reconcile it to a recipient using a clientId.
  
 If a user only wants to send push notifications to subscribers linked to a profile. In that case, it should be easily achievable by using profiles as filtering dimensions in their workflows. But there is a use case.

A user could log off, and then it should stop receiving notifications. And later, they could log in with a different account on the same mobile. We believe the `registrationToken` (in Android at least) is valid from the installation of the app.
  
 We haven’t found any API reference in the *AEP SDK*to delete or invalidate the `registrationToken`, so how can we achieve this use case? Not sure if we can emulate it by invoking the `setPushIdentifier` or `registerDevice` again or if this has to be handled with the `AuthenticationState` within the mobileApp code.
  
 How should it be done?


## Resolution


This scenario is common to a certain extent. During the logoff, they should send the same API used to register the *Customer Id*, but emptying it, the field `userKey` will be empty, and the link to the recipient will be cut. That can be done in the login with a `userKey` populated with a *Customer ID*linked to Recipient/Profile. After logout, the `Userkey` will be emptied.

The Mobile app needs to make a call to ACC on User logout/login to update this info on ACC. We can have a custom boolean field that we use as a flag to identify if an app subscriber is logged in or logged out.
