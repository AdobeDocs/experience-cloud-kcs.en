# ACC AEP SDK Logon-Logoff

## Description


In general, we integrate the AEP or Neolane SDK to execute `setPushIdenfitier` or `registerDevice` method to register the token in campaign and reconciliate it to a recipient by using a `clientId`.
 
This customer only wants to send push notifications to subscribers linked to a profile, it should be easily achievable just by using profiles as filtering dimensions in their workflows. But there is a use case.
A customer could log off and then it should stop receiving notifications. And later could log in with a different account in the same mobile. I believe the registrationToken (in Android at least) is valid from the installation of the app.
 
I haven’t found any API reference in the AEP SDK to delete or invalidate the `registrationToken`, so I’m wondering how we can achieve this use case. Not sure if we can emulate it by invoking again the `setPushIdentifier` or `registerDevice`, or if this has to be handled with the `AuthenticationState` within the mobileApp code.
 
Anybody has implemented already this kind of use case or has an idea on how it should be done?


## Resolution


This scenario is common in certain extend. During the logoff, they should send the same API used to register the Customer Id, but emptying it, the field `userKey` will be then empty and the link to recipient will then be cut. That can be done in the login à `userKey` populated with a Customer ID linked of Recipient/Profile, logout à `Userkey` emptied.

The Mobile app needs to make a call to ACC on User logout/login to update this info on ACC. We can have a custom boolean field, that we use as a flag to identify if an app subscriber is in logged in or logged out state.
