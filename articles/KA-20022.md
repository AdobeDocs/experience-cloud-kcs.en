# Workspace Project truncated when scheduling or downloading PDF

## Description {#description}

Scheduled or downloaded PDF contains truncated rows as below example.

## Resolution {#resolution}


On the truncated Freeform table, click the "Return to default height" icon, save the project, then reschedule or download the Workspace Project again.

Root Cause:
It is very similar to a collapsed panel, and when downloading a collapsed pdf, it will not expand the panel.
For the same reason, we need to expand the truncated Freeform table by clicking the "Return to default height" icon. It is working as design.
