# Winning Experience different for Reporting Audience in A4T activity

## Description


<b>Environment</b>

Target



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Why is the Winning Experience different for the Reporting Audiences in A4T Target activity reports?




## Resolution


- The reason why the global winner is different is that it is determined based on the default/primary goal metric value captured in Target, whereas the reporting winner is determined purely based on the data obtained from Analytics.
- Ideally, the two should be the same but given that there can be a difference in data, these two can be different.
