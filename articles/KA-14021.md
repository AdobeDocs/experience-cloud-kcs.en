# Why is the Winning Experience different for Reporting Audience in A4T activity?

## Description


The Winning Experience is different for the Reporting Audiences in A4T Target activity reports.


## Resolution


- The reason why the global winner is different is that it is determined based on the default/primary goal metric value captured in Target, whereas the reporting winner is determined purely based on the data obtained from Analytics.
- Ideally, the two should be the same but given there can be a difference in data, these two can be different.
