# Why is the Winning Experience different for Reporting Audience in A4T activity?

## Description


When seeing the reports of an A4T Target activity, we see that the Wiining Experience is different for the Reporting Audiences.


## Resolution


The reason why the global winner is different is that it is determined based on the default/ primary goal metric value captured in target whereas the reporting winner is determined purely based on the data obtained from the Analytics.

Ideally the two should be the same but given there can be difference in the data, these two can be different.
