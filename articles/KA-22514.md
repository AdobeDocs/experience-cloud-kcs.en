# Auto-reply to the emails received from ACC platform

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Campaign Classic



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Getting replies on the sender address instead of the reply address. Is it possible to implement an auto-response to emails that are sent from the platform?


## Resolution {#resolution}


This feature is not supported by ACC (Adobe Campaign Classic) OOTB (out of the box).
<b>Possible workarounds to achieve this:</b>
1. Try to use the same address for both *Reply address* and *Sender address*?
2. Try to create a feedback mail box for giving reply to the addresses and then set auto replies for the same.
3. Configure the *Reply-to* address with the working email address and use any external <b>Auto Responder</b> utility to send a pre-defined auto-reply message.
