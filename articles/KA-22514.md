# Auto-reply to the emails received from ACC platform


You are getting replies at the sender address instead of the reply address, and you want to implement auto-response to emails sent from the Adobe Campaign Classic. This feature is not supported by ACC out of the box, but you can try the workarounds given below.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Classic



### Issue/Symptoms

Getting replies on the sender address instead of the reply address. Is it possible to implement an auto-response to emails that are sent from the platform?


## Resolution {#resolution}


This feature is not supported by Adobe Campaign Classic out of the box.

Possible workarounds to achieve this:

1. Try to use the same address for both the *Reply address* and the *Sender address.*
2. Create a feedback mailbox to give replies to the addresses and then set auto-replies for the same.
3. Configure the *Reply-to* address with the working email address and use any external <b>Auto Responder</b> utility to send a pre-defined auto-reply message.
