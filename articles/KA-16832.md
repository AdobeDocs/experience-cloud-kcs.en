## Resolution {#resolution}


The problem is the usage of a target mapping based on an extended recipient schema where the delivery log and tracking log schemas have not been extended for the same. A target mapping must be unique in terms of recipient schema vs delivery log/tracking log schemas.

It's impossible to use multiple targeting schemas with the same `trackinglog` schema since the tracking workflow will be unable to reconcile data with the targeting id.

In case the customer does not want to use `OOB` target mapping (with `nms:recipient`), We recommend two approaches:

- If you want to use a custom targeting dimension, you need to create custom `broadLog/trackingLog` schemas using `nms:broadlog` as a template (c.f `nms:broadLogRcp, nms:broadLogSvc,` etc.)

    - targeting schema: `cus:recipient` (extended from `nms:recipient` or fully custom)
    - broadcast log schema: `cus:broadLogRcp` (extended from `nms:broadLogRcp` or fully custom)
    - tracking log schema: `cus:trackingLogRcp` (extended from `nms:broadLogRcp` or fully custom)
- If you want to use `OOB trackingLogRcp/broadLogRcp`, the targeting dimension needs to be `nms:recipient` and the filtering dimension could be a custom schema
