# How to find workflows that are in progress




Here are a couple of tricks for finding active workflows:

## Description {#description}





## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>1- Filtering workflows according to their status</b>
https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/automating-with-workflows/monitoring-workflows/monitoring-workflow-execution.html?lang=en#filtering-workflows-status
-`>`  This is found under the <b>Administration / Audit / Workflows Status</b> node

<b>2- What actually means a workflow is 'In Progress'?</b>
- A workflow is 'in progress' when it has a non-zero PID assigned (@processId)
- Scheduled workflows will be 'started', but their PID will be 0 since the wfserver isn't processing/running it.
- You can filter on workflows where @processId != 0 and this will give you any workflows currently in progress
-`>`  Same filter being used in the Audit trail above
