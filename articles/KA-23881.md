## Description {#description}


### Environments

### Issue

Here are a couple of tricks for finding active workflows:


## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>1. Filtering workflows according to their status</b>
[Monitor workflow execution: Filtering workflows according to their status](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/automating-with-workflows/monitoring-workflows/monitoring-workflow-execution.html?lang=en#filtering-workflows-status)  in Campaign Classic v7 Documentation.
-`>`  This is found under the <b>Administration / Audit / Workflows Status</b> node.

<b>2. What actually means a workflow is "In Progress"?</b>
- A workflow is "in progress" when it has a non-zero PID assigned (`@processId`).
- Scheduled workflows will be "started", but their PID will be *0* since the `wfserver` isn't processing/running it.
- You can filter on workflows where `@processId != 0` and this will give you any workflows currently in progress.
- Same filter being used in the Audit trail above.
