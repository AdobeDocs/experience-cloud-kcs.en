# Adobe Experience Manager: The content path called from SDI has changed since AEM 6.5.13

## Description {#description}


There is a change which relates to cache utilization in SDI, since AEM 6.5.13. This article explains the detail of the change.

<b>Environments</b>
 AEM 6.5.13 or higher


## Resolution {#resolution}


The change was introduced as NPR-38214`[` 1`]`  to resolve a responsive grid issue. As a result, a suffix is added to the content path for SDI include. The dispatcher cannot cache the URL with a suffix. If you use SDI, check for a significant change in the publish instance's load.
