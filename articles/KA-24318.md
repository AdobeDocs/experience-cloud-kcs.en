# Dynamic media assets aren't published with the correct "scene7FileStatus" metadata attribute

## Description {#description}


<b>Description</b>:

This issue is happening in all the environments.
 Here are the steps to reproduce the issue:

1. Upload an asset to a folder that is replicating to DynamicMedia-scene7

2. Once is uploaded you can see the status "dam:scene7FileStatus": "PublishIncomplete"

3. Publish the asset

Current result:
 The asset is published correctly:
 1. In the author the metadata shows "dam:scene7FileStatus": "PublishComplete". This is correct
 2. The asset in the publisher shows an incorrect status:
 "dam:scene7FileStatus": "PublishIncomplete"

Expected result:
 The asset in the publisher should be "dam:scene7FileStatus": "PublishComplete

We suspect that AEM is not waiting for the Dynamic media status update before publishing the metadata. In our current state we ask the author to publish the assets twice. From our perspective this should be an OOTB feature where AEM should keep the status consistent and the publication should be coordinated.


## Resolution {#resolution}


What you are observing is expected, the DM publish happens after the AEM
 publish. At the time the AEM publish takes place, the DM publish has
 not run yet, hence the Scene7 file status does not reflect the final
 status.

 To sort this out, please do the following on the author:
 Go to /system/console/configMgr
 Find this entry:
 com.day.cq.dam.scene7.impl.listener.Scene7ActivationJobConsumer

 and mark the checkBox "Replicate Metadata after DM publishing".
 This will trigger an additional metadata sync task after the DM
 replication is complete and should sort out the issue you are running
 into.
