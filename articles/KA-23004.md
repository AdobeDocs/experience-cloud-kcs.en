# Repository Browser does not show complete values of properties


When the repository browser doesn't display a complete property value, adding "-1.json" to the URL and downloading a JSON file will make the values visible.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Experience Manager as a Cloud Service



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

The repository browser does not show the complete value of a property.

<b>Steps to reproduce:</b> Go to the repository browser of an environment and check a node that has a property with a lot of values.

<b>Expected Result:</b> All the values of the property should be visible.

<b>Actual Result:</b> The list of values of the property is cut short. The entries cannot be selected, nor can we scroll to the right.
