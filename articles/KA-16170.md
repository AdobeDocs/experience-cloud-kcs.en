# Target - Hiding registration form for the user who completes registration

## Description


We have a registration form on the page where we tracking those in adobe analytics. We would like to hide the registration form for the user whoever completed the registration and instead we will show them some relevant campaign content. Also, registration form shouldn’t appear even though if they come and visit gain on the page.

How can we proceed to achieve this through adobe target. Please provide your suggestion, let me know if any.


## Resolution

 <br><br>
You can create a Segment based on this (Trait) i.e eVarXX = 'ZZZ Form Submitted' in AAM and this segment would be available in adobe target.

In Adobe Target , Create a new activity and for the Segment created in AAM hide the form and display an alternative content.



If you do not use AAM, you can create the segment in Analytics and share the same with Adobe Target.
