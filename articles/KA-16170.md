# Hiding registration form for user who completes registration

## Description

<br>Environment<br><br>
Target
<br><br>Issue/Symptoms<br><br>
We have a registration form on the page where we track those in Adobe Analytics. We would like to hide the registration form for the users, who have completed the registration and instead we will show them some relevant campaign content. Also, the registration form shouldnâ€™t appear even if they come and visit again on the page.

How can we achieve this through Adobe Target?


## Resolution


You can create a s*egment* based on this *(Trait)* i.e., `eVarXX = 'ZZZ Form Submitted'` in Adobe Audience Manager (AAM) and this segment would be available in Adobe Target.

[https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/audience-manager/user-guide/features/traits/trait-builder/abo...](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/audience-manager/user-guide/features/traits/trait-builder/about-trait-builder.html)

In Adobe Target, create a new activity and for the segment created in AAM, hide the form and display an alternative content.



If you do not use AAM, you can create the segment in Analytics and share the same with Adobe Target.
