# Hiding registration form for the user who completes registration

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
Adobe Target
<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
There is a registration form on the page which is tracked in Adobe Analytics. Is there any way to hide the registration form from users who have completed the registration, and instead show them some relevant campaign content.

How can we achieve this through Adobe Target?


## Resolution {#resolution}


You can create a Segment based on this (Trait) i.e., `eVarXX = 'ZZZ Form Submitted'` in Adobe Audience Manager (AAM) and this segment would be available in Adobe Target.

For more information, visit:

- [Trait Builder](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/features/traits/trait-builder/about-trait-builder.html?lang=en)
- [Segment Builder](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/features/segments/segment-builder.html?lang=en)


In Adobe Target, create a new activity and for the Segment created in AAM hide the form and display an alternative content.

If you do not use AAM, you can create the segment in Analytics and share the same with Adobe Target.
