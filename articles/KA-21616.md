# AAM Trait Population API Metrics Definitions

## Description {#description}

When [retrieving a trait by its ID via the API](https://bank.demdex.com/portal/swagger/index.html#/Traits%20API/get_traits__sid_), one can see the metrics using the includeMetrics query string parameter. However, it's unclear how the values in the response (count1Day, uniques1Day, and so forth) map to the reporting values from the AAM UI (Device ID Unique Realizations, Cross-Device iD Unique Realizations, and so on).Â 

## Resolution {#resolution}


The metrics in the JSON response from the API call map to the AAM UI metrics as follows:

- Device ID Unique Trait Realizations = uniqesxDay
- Device ID Total Trait Population = populationUniquesxDay
- Cross-Device Unique Trait Realizations = countxDay
- Cross-Device Total Trait Population = populationCountxDay


Where x represents the 1,7, 14, 30, 60, or 90 day values
