# AAM Trait Population API Metric Definitions

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b><br>Audience Manager<br> <br> <br><b>Issues/Symptoms</b><br>When [retrieving a trait by its ID via the API](https://bank.demdex.com/portal/swagger/index.html#/Traits%20API/get_traits__sid_), one can see the metrics using the `includeMetrics` query string parameter. However, it's unclear how the values in the response (count1Day, uniques1Day, and so forth) map to the reporting values from the AAM UI (Device ID Unique Realizations, Cross-Device iD Unique Realizations, and so on). 

## Resolution {#resolution}


The metrics in the JSON response from the API call map to the AAM UI metrics as follows:

- Device ID Unique Trait Realizations = uniqesxDay
- Device ID Total Trait Population = populationUniquesxDay


Unfortunately, the API does not report on Cross-device ID metrics.
