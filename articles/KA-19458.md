# Unable to start workflow in Campaign Classic

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

- Adobe Campaign Classic

- Adobe Campaign Classic v7

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

The below workflow does not run even after changing the 'created by' field in the workflow properties.

Workflow internal name: ``prdWKFXXXX``

If we try to run this workflow, the Campaign jobs(operationMgt) monitoring workflow throws an invalid login error.

<b>Errors from workflow</b>: (Campaign jobs(operationMgt))




```
BAS-010003 Unable to complete operation in current status.
WKF-560044 Error while sending notification with delivery template 'notify supervisor.' Please refer to the delivery log ID 00000 for more information (object associated with the workflow task).
DLV-490118 Error during preparation. Please refer to the delivery action journal '27626534' for more information.
SCR-160012 JavaScript: Error while evaluating script 'operationMgt/scheduler'.
XSV-350012 Invalid login or password. Connection denied.
```




Started targeting workflow 'prdWKF0000' for campaign 'Campaign name (internal name of the workflow)'

<b>Analysis: </b>
 While starting this workflow: `prdWKF00000`, the workflow Campaign jobs(operationMgt) started failing. Upon looking for more information on what could have caused this, followed by a review of the workflow XML, the issue was identified.




```
<process forecasted="0" login="xxxxx@xxxx.com" priority="0"

           processState="20" startState="0"/>
```




The operator mentioned above was disabled, which led to the failure of the Campaign jobs workflow.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Replace the login with an active operator and save the changes to the workflow and re-execute the workflow. This should fix the problem.




```
<process forecasted="0" login="ranjan" priority="0"
           processState="20" startState="0"/>
```
