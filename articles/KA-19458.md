# Unable to start workflow

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

- Adobe Campaign Classic

- Adobe Campaign Classic v7

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

The below workflow does not run even after changing the 'created by' field in the workflow properties.

Workflow internal name: prdWKFXXXX

If we try to run this workflow, the Campaign jobs(operationMgt) monitoring workflow throws an invalid login error.

<b>Error from workflow</b>: (Campaign jobs(operationMgt))
 BAS-010003 Unable to complete operation in current status.
 WKF-560044 Error while sending notification with delivery template 'notify supervisor.' Please refer to the delivery log ID 00000 for more information (object associated with the workflow task).
 DLV-490118 Error during preparation. Please refer to the delivery action journal '27626534' for more information.
 SCR-160012 JavaScript: Error while evaluating script 'operationMgt/scheduler'.
 XSV-350012 Invalid login or password. Connection denied.

Started targeting workflow 'prdWKF0000' for campaign 'Campaign name (internal name of the workflow)'

<b>Analysis: </b>
 While starting this workflow: prdWKF00000, the workflow Campaign jobs(operationMgt) started failing. Upon looking for more information on what could have caused this, followed by a review of the workflow XML, the issue was identified.




```
process forecasted="0" login="xxxxx@xxxx.com" priority="0"
           processState="20" startState="0"/
```




The operator mentioned above was disabled, which led to the failure of the Campaign jobs workflow.


## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Solution</b>:  Replaced the login with an active operator and saved the changes to the workflow and re-executed the workflow. This fixed the problem.




```
process forecasted="0" login="ranjan" priority="0"           processState="20" startState="0"/
```
