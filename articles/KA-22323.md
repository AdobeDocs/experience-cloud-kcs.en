# VLT RCP content synchronization fail

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Experience Manager

### Issue/Symptoms

While using VLT RCP command (with the latest 3.6.8 version of vault-cli) to sync content from one author environment to another, the AEM 6.5.17 is failing with <b>`NoSuchNodeTypeException`</b> related to node <b>indexedData</b>. The newly created content fragments (post SP17 installation) also get a node called<b> indexedData </b>under <b>jcr:content</b>.

This new node was introduced for SITES-8297/SITES-97 in SP17.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The destination environment AEM version is 6.5.16. The issue can be fixed by upgrading the destination system to SP17 (Version - 6.5.17.0).
<br>Cause
The error occurs when the tool is trying to import a node to a destination system that does not have the respective node type definition.
