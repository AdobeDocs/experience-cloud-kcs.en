# VLT RCP content sync fail

## Description {#description}


<b>Description</b> :

When using VLT RCP command (with the latest 3.6.8 version of vault-cli) to sync content from one author environment to another in AEM 6.5.17  is failing with  NoSuchNodeTypeException related to node "indexedData"

The newly created content fragments (post SP17 installation) now also get a node called "indexedData" under jcr:content

This new node was introduced for SITES-8297/SITES-97 in SP17


## Resolution {#resolution}


The destination environment AEM version is 6.5.16

The error occurs as the tool is trying to import a node to a destination system which doesn't have the according node type definition.

The issue is fixed by upgrading the destination system to SP 17
