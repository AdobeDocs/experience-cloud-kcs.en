# '\*\*\*' in geo_country column in Analytics Data Feed

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b><br>Analytics<br> <br><b>Issue/Symptom</b><br>Reason for `<b>*` value in the `geo_country` column in Analytics Data Feed file.



 

## Resolution {#resolution}

`</b>*` comes up when the hit has an `IPv6` value designated for testing. In such cases, the `geo_country` returns `<b>*` and the `geo_city` returns reserved.
