# Assets and Folders questions

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

1. Is there a recommended limit of images that can be published by a multiple selection?

2. Is there a recommended limit of images that can be contained in a single folder?


## Resolution {#resolution}


1. There should be no such limit, however, there is a known limitation in the UI which limits any action performed to a maximum of 100 assets. This issue is reported in the internal Jira request - [ASSETS-10808](https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/ASSETS-10808)Â and the engineering team is actively working on fixing this.  

    

    Moreover, replication happens in batches by default, so it should be okay in terms of server load. It does, however, mean that if it's a large number of files it could hog your replication queue until the process is done.


2. We recommend no more than 1,000 direct images.
