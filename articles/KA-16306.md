# Target AEM Integration may cause an error which says 'invalid workspace'

## Description


When integrating AEM and [!DNL Target] using IMS, an error that says "invalid workspace" has been seen in the error.log file of AEM when passing an XF from AEM to Target.


## Resolution


As a workaround, please try to use the legacy way of integration and see if this resolves the invalid workspace error.
