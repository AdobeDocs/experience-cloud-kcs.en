## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>

As a workaround use Legacy Cloud services to integrate AEM and Target as outlined in [Using AEM Legacy Cloud Services](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/aem-target-tutorial/aem-target-implementation/using-aem-cloud-services.html) in the Getting Started with AEM and Adobe Target guide.
