# Content Fragment Model can't be edited

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Experience Manager 6.5

<b>Issue</b>
 User is unable to edit a Content Fragment Model (CFM) configuration, and observes this error message in the logs:

`06.05.2022 13:55:25.132 *ERROR* `[` `[` 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1`]`  `[` 1651825525074`]`  GET /mnt/overlay/dam/cfm/models/editor/content/editor.html/conf/myproject/settings/dam/cfm/models/mycompanymodels HTTP/1.1`]`  libs.dam.cfm.models.editor.components.formbuilder.formbuilder$jsp The model config resource is a non-existing resource.`


## Resolution {#resolution}


This error message is logged when the Content Fragment Model has been configured in a subfolder.
For example: `/conf/we-retail/settings/dam/cfm/models/sub-config/we-retail-store-info`

Moving the CFM configuration directly to the `/models` folder should solve the issue.
`/conf/we-retail/settings/dam/cfm/models/we-retail-store-info`
