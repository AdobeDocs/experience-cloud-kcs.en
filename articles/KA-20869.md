# Garbled characters in Analytics Data Feed

## Description {#description}

<br>Garbled characters might be seen in Analytics Data Feed. For example, <b>répéteur</b> is shown as <b>rÃ©pÃ©teur</b>, <b>hülle</b> is shown as <b>hÃ¼lle</b>, etc. This use case is limited to Data Feeds and is not applicable to Analysis Workspace or API output.<br>

## Resolution {#resolution}


Data Feed does not apply any encoding to the data. It simply takes the raw data, does very simple filtering and passes the data along in its raw form. The raw data from Data Feeds makes no attempt to change the encoding. The data seen in Data Feeds is as it is passed from the implementation.

Encoding can, however, be applied when reading the data to see the correct characters. For example, to read rÃ©pÃ©teur as répéteur, Latin-1 encoding can be applied when reading the raw data file.

1. Save the file in CSV format.

2. Open the file in a text editor.

3. Save the file and choose encoding as "ANSI".

4. Open the saved file to see the correct Latin encoded characters.
