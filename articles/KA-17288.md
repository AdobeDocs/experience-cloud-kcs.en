# JVM-510037 Cannot find the [!DNL Java] dynamic library.

## Description

<b>Use case</b> - A customer has reported an issue while replacing [!DNL Oracle] JDK with [!DNL Open] JDK on their [!DNL Campaign] instances running on [!DNL Windows].

They currently have [!DNL Oracle] JDK v1.8.0.191 installed on all their [!DNL Windows] [!DNL Campaign] instances. Still, after replacing [!DNL Oracle] JDK with [!DNL Open] JDK  in one of their [!DNL Campaign] instances, the WEB has failed to start with the following error:

<b>`JVM-510037 Cannot find the Java dynamic library. Check that a JDK or a JRE is installed on the machine. (iRc=-53)`</b>

However, [!DNL Java] is correctly installed with the right Path and `JAVA_HOME` environment variables.

## Resolution

In order to run the Web module, the JVM dynamic library must be visible to [!DNL Campaign]. By removing [!DNL Oracle] JDK, the [!DNL JavaSoft] key from the [!DNL Windows] registry is removed and any references to that JVM library is also lost.

There are 2 solutions to resolve this issue:

1. You can manually add the [!DNL JavaSoft] key to the [!DNL Windows] registry under `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE`.

   Here's an example (with OpenJDK 1.8_292) of what you need to add:

   ```
   Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
   
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\JavaSoft
   
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\JavaSoft\Java Runtime Environment
   "CurrentVersion"="1.8"
   "BrowserJavaVersion"="11.301.2"
   
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\JavaSoft\Java Runtime Environment\1.8
   "MicroVersion"="0"
   "RuntimeLib"="C:\\Users\\perth\\Java\\openjdk-8u292-b10\\jre\\bin\\server\\jvm.dll"
   "JavaHome"="C:\\Users\\perth\\Java\\openjdk-8u292-b10\\jre"
   
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\JavaSoft\Java Runtime Environment\1.8.0_292
   "MicroVersion"="0"
   "RuntimeLib"="C:\\Users\\perth\\Java\\openjdk-8u292-b10\\jre\\bin\\server\\jvm.dll"
   "JavaHome"="C:\\Users\\perth\\Java\\openjdk-8u292-b10\\jre"
   ```

   And the following path folder has been added to the <b>`Path`</b> environment variable.

   ```
   C:\Users\perth\Java\openjdk-8u292-b10\bin
   ```

   The Web module should be able to start as expected:

1. The usage of two [!DNL Windows] environment variables can be defined to indicate where the `jvm.dll` file can be found by the Web module.

   The variables are:

   - `USEENV=1`
   - `JVMLIBDIR=*the path of the jvm.dll file*`

   Here's an example:

   Please note that the usage of the `JVMLIBDIR` will be visible from the log if the verbose logging is enable on the Web module.
