# JVM-510037 Cannot find the Java dynamic library.

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign Classic v7



<b>Issues/Symptoms</b>
<b>Use case</b> - An issue has been reported while replacing Oracle JDK with Open JDK on Campaign instances running on Windows.

The customer currently has Oracle JDK v1.8.0.191 installed on all Windows Campaign instances. Still, after replacing Oracle JDK with Open JDK  in one of their Campaign instances, the WEB has failed to start with the following error:

<b>`JVM-510037 Cannot find the Java dynamic library. Check that a JDK or a JRE is installed on the machine. (iRc=-53)`</b>

However, Java is correctly installed with the right Path and JAVA_HOME environment variables.


## Resolution {#resolution}


In order to run the Web module, the JVM dynamic library must be visible to Campaign. By removing Oracle JDK, the JavaSoft key from the Windows registry is removed and any references to that JVM library is also lost.

There are 2 solutions to resolve this issue:

First is, you can manually add the JavaSoft key to the Windows registry under Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE.

Here's an example (with `OpenJDK 1.8_292`) of what you need to add:

`Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00`

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\JavaSoft`




```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\JavaSoft\Java Runtime Environment"CurrentVersion"="1.8""BrowserJavaVersion"="11.301.2"
```





```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\JavaSoft\Java Runtime Environment\1.8"MicroVersion"="0""RuntimeLib"="C:\\Users\\perth\\Java\\openjdk-8u292-b10\\jre\\bin\\server\\jvm.dll""JavaHome"="C:\\Users\\perth\\Java\\openjdk-8u292-b10\\jre"
```





```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\JavaSoft\Java Runtime Environment\1.8.0_292"MicroVersion"="0""RuntimeLib"="C:\\Users\\perth\\Java\\openjdk-8u292-b10\\jre\\bin\\server\\jvm.dll""JavaHome"="C:\\Users\\perth\\Java\\openjdk-8u292-b10\\jre"
```


 
And the following path folder has been added to the <b>Path </b>environment variable.

`C:\Users\perth\Java\openjdk-8u292-b10\bin`

The Web module should be able to start as expected:

Second is, the usage of two Windows environment variables can be defined to indicate where the jvm.dll file can be found by the Web module.

The variables are:

- USEENV=1
- JVMLIBDIR=*the path of the jvm.dll file*


Here's an example:

Please note that the usage of the JVMLIBDIR will be visible from the log if the verbose logging is enable on the Web module.
