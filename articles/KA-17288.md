# JVM-510037 Cannot find the Java dynamic library.

## Description


<b>Use case</b> - A customer has reported an issue while replacing `Oracle JDK` with  on their Campaign instances running on Windows.

They currently have `Oracle JDK v1.8.0.191` installed on all their Windows Campaign instances. Still, after replacing `Oracle JDK` with `Open JDK`  in one of their Campaign instances, the *WEB*has failed to start with the following error:

<b>`JVM-510037 Cannot find the Java dynamic library. Check that a JDK or a JRE is installed on the machine. (iRc=-53)`</b>

However, Java is correctly installed with the right Path and JAVA_HOME environment variables.


## Resolution


In order to run the Web module, the `JVM dynamic` library must be visible to Campaign. By removing `Oracle JDK`, the *JavaSoft*key from the Windows registry is removed and any references to that *JVM*library is also lost.

There are 2 solutions to resolve this issue:

1) You can manually add the *JavaSoft*key to the Windows registry under Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE.

Here's an example (with OpenJDK 1.8_292) of what you need to add:

`Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00`

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\JavaSoft`




```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\JavaSoft\Java Runtime Environment"CurrentVersion"="1.8""BrowserJavaVersion"="11.301.2"
```





```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\JavaSoft\Java Runtime Environment\1.8"MicroVersion"="0""RuntimeLib"="C:\\Users\\perth\\Java\\openjdk-8u292-b10\\jre\\bin\\server\\jvm.dll""JavaHome"="C:\\Users\\perth\\Java\\openjdk-8u292-b10\\jre"
```





```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\JavaSoft\Java Runtime Environment\1.8.0_292"MicroVersion"="0""RuntimeLib"="C:\\Users\\perth\\Java\\openjdk-8u292-b10\\jre\\bin\\server\\jvm.dll""JavaHome"="C:\\Users\\perth\\Java\\openjdk-8u292-b10\\jre"
```


 
And the following path folder has been added to the <b>Path </b>environment variable.

`C:\Users\perth\Java\openjdk-8u292-b10\bin`

The Web module should be able to start as expected:

2) The usage of two Windows environment variables can be defined to indicate where the jvm.dll file can be found by the Web module.

The variables are:

- USEENV=1
- JVMLIBDIR=*the path of the jvm.dll file*


Here's an example:

Please note that the usage of the JVMLIBDIR will be visible from the log if the verbose logging is enable on the Web module.
