# Repurcussions of deleting a web property in Adobe Launch

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Analytics

<b>Issue</b>
<u><b>These are repercussions of deleting a web property in Adobe Launch.</b></u>
 They are listed in the Resolution section below.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Adobe Launch libraries are hosted on either a CDN *(Akamai)* or on the client's servers (self-hosting).
 Currently, the primary CDN provider is *Akamai*.
 Files hosted on *Akamai*have a domain of `assets.adobedtm.com.` On deleting a web property, the library will still remain on the CDN or the client's server.
 This won't disrupt the firing of the Launch tags or Analytics (or any other solution) server calls from the website.
 There are certain obvious repercussions.
 It won't be possible to manage changes to any components (rules, data elements, extensions, etc.) within the web property.
 Note that, a web property once deleted can't be restored.
