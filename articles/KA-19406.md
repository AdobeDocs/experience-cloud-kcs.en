# Is it possible to restore a deleted delivery


While there is no established standard to restore a deleted delivery in Adobe Campaign Standard, you could explore point-in-time recovery of the entire databaseÂ (but not without potential data loss).

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Campaign Standard (ACS)

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Is it possible to restore a delivery if it was deleted by accident?


## Resolution {#resolution}


In ACS, there is no recycle bin to recover deleted deliveries from. Hence, if delivery is deleted, there is no standard way to restore it.

Point-in-time recovery of the entire database can be explored if it is critical and necessary to have the deleted delivery(ies) back. However, that will lead to data loss for the period elapsed since then.
