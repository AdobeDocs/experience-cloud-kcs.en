# Cloud Manager pipeline fails to connect to private repository


If the Cloud Manager pipeline fails to connect to a private repository, specify the password as a secret pipeline variable.



## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Managed Services 6.5.13

### Issue/Symptoms

Cloud manager build step fails when trying to run '`npm login`' which is required for downloading npm packages from a private repository.

The problem is in obtaining package from a jfrog artifactory while running the pipeline.


## Resolution {#resolution}


This can be achieved by specifying the password (and optionally, the username) as a secret pipeline variable. Please follow the steps in `[` 1`]` .

The secret pipeline variables can be added using Adobe AIO CLI.
