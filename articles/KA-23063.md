# Cloud Manager pipeline fails to connect to private repository


Environment: AEM Managed Services 6.5.13

## Description {#description}


Cloud manager build step fails when trying to run 'npm login' which is required for downloading npm packages from a private repository.

The problem is in obtaining package from a jfrog artifactory while running the pipeline.


## Resolution {#resolution}


This can be achieved by specifying the password (and optionally, the username) as a secret pipeline variable,
Please follow the steps in `[` 1`]` .

The secret pipeline variables can be added using Adobe AIO CLI.

Please follow document `[` 2`]`  on how to set up AIO CLI.
