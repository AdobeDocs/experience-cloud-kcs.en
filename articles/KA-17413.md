# Precautions for modifying global mbox of an account

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
Target


<b>Issues/Symptoms</b>
Will modifying the global `mbox` of an account mess with existing experiments or anything else? Is this safe to do and if so, what precautions should be taken?


## Resolution {#resolution}


A few points to note are:

1. Changing the global `mbox` will only change the `mbox` of future activities. It will have no effect on already existing activities.
2. The only problem that might arise is if the same website is being targeted for both new and old activities. The `at.js` on the site would need to be updated for the new activities to show up.
3. A copy of the activity could be made and modified rather than changing the `mbox` on the fly. Metrics such as conversions are counted based on what `mbox` was seen so changing this could make some reports confusing.
