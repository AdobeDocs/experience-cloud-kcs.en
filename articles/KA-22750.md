# Branding of WebApps URLs in Campaign Classic


This article provides a solution to the question whether a URL can be modified/personalized to have a particular company's name instead of Adobe servers, while still being hosted by Adobe servers.

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
Adobe Campaign Classic (ACC)

<b>Issue</b>
For WebApps, the content is hosted on Adobe servers, and the WebApp URLs look like this format:

`https://adobeServer/webapp/otherValues`

Can this URL be modified/personalized to have a particular company's name instead of Adobe servers, while still being hosted by Adobe servers?
(Example: For emails, the mails are sent from Adobe server, but you can use subdomains like "brandA.com" or "brandB.com" by configuring `CNAMES`, etc.)


## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Solutions</b>
This can be achieved by branding.

The documentation link for branding in Adobe Campaign Standard (ACS) is [https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-standard/using/administrating/application-settings/branding.html](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-standard/using/administrating/application-settings/branding.html).


However, for ACC, there currently isn't any documentation for Campaign Classic.

If this needs to be done in Campaign Classic, you can follow the below steps:
1. Sub-domains that need to be used should be properly configured and delegated.
2. External accounts need to be used for the sub-domains.
3. Custom options need to be created for the tracking mirror and WebApp.
4. Add the sub-domain in the <b>authorized sender address</b> and the <b>error address</b>.
5. Then, you can use the custom option in WebApp to show the URL as mentioned.
