# How does the Visitor Identification process takes place in Target

## Description


How Target identifies visitors (i.e. which variables and in what order)?


## Resolution


1. Visitor is identified based on mboxpcid or mcid or thirdpartid.
2. mboxpcid is basically generated by our Target tag on customer's web page and we write a cookie for that visitor, so we know that this visitor has fired a call to target before or not.
3. Similarly mcid is created by visitorapi on the page and this id is made available across marketing cloud solutions
4. Thirdpartyid are provided by customer themselves so it depends on how they identify their visitors
5. On subsequent visit visitor may be identified as long as the cookie is not deleted or the profile doesn't expire on our systems (based on time to live).
6. Finally in terms of reports it very different by solution. i.e. one may visit a page and they may get counted as visitor in analytics, but in target we count visitors only in the context of the given activity (i.e. if the visitor qualifies for the activity and is served an experience pertaining to that activity).
7. In A4T context :


"unique visitors' - includes user's activity once they've entered the test even if they dont interact with test content per session afterwards

“Visits” includes user visits that do not include seeing an activity

“activity impressions”: increments each time a visitor sees the actual test content (basically each server call from Target to Analytics counts)

"instances": increments once per page when activity content was seen

impressions and instances are equal unless there are multiple mbox calls on the same page in the same activity - thus causing multiple impressions to be counted but still a single instance.
