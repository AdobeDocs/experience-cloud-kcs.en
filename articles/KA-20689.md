# AMS users want to access OSGi console


To allow users in an Admin group to access the Felix console for configurations, bundles, etc., they can use the Admin user credentials to log in at `<IP>:<PORT>/system/console/configMgr`. Make sure to add their group to the *Group Names*to grant the necessary access.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)


- AEM Managed Services




### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Certain users who are part of the Admin group require access to the Felix console for configurations, bundles, and other functionalities.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Please access the OSGi console using the Admin user - `<IP>:<PORT>/system/console/configMgr`, search and edit *Apache Sling Web Console Security Provider* and verify that the group your users are part of is added to the *Group Names*.

If the group is not present here, please add it and the users will be able to access the OSGi console.
