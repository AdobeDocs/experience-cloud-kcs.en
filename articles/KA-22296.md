# Campaign Analytics connection error: AnalyticsAPIException: received 403, Forbidden

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

On-premises:

- Adobe Analytics
- Adobe Campaign


### Issue/Symptoms

When you create an external account, you struggle to connect to Adobe Analytics and the following error displays:

*Cannot process request for method 'getIMSOrgDetails'. Error Message: 'AnalyticsAPIException: received 403,Forbidden, `<` HTML`>` `<` HEAD`>` '. Request Details: '{"method":"getIMSOrgDetails","internalName":"cxb_AC_AAIntegration_CXB","useUserAccessTokenIfPresent":"true"}'*


## Resolution {#resolution}


As an on-premises customer, if a firewall is implemented on your side, you must add the Analytics endpoint `analytics.adobe.io/discovery/me` to your allowlist.

### Cause

The Analytics endpoint was not in the allowlist.
