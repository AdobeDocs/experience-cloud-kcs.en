# "[!UICONTROL Workflow Duration]" value in [!UICONTROL Workflow HeatMap] doesn't show past executions

## Description


<b>Environments</b>
 Adobe Campaign Classic
 Adobe Campaign

<b>Issue</b>

The [!UICONTROL Workflow Duration] value in the [!UICONTROL Workflow HeatMap] does not show past executions.

For example, when checking a workflow at a different time within the same day, the [!UICONTROL Workflow Duration] value will stay the same regardless of which execution time is chosen.


## Resolution


<b>Resolution</b>

This behavior is by design, because this value will only be filled with the last execution duration of the workflow for a particular day.
There is no historization of that data. 
When selecting a different day, the [!UICONTROL Workflow Duration] will change but will only show the last execution duration for that day.
