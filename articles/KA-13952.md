# "Workflow Duration" value in Workflow Heatmap doesn't show past executions


This article explains why the *Workflow Duration* value in a Workflow Heatmap doesn't show past executions.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environments</b>

Adobe Campaign Classic

### <b>Issue</b>

The `Workflow Duration` value in the Workflow Heatmap does not show past executions.

For example, when checking a workflow at a different time within the same day, the `Workflow Duration` value will stay the same regardless of which execution time is chosen.


## Resolution {#resolution}


This behavior is by design, because this value will only be filled with the last execution duration of the workflow for a particular day. There is no historization of that data. When selecting a different day, the `Workflow Duration` will change but will only show the last execution duration for that day.
