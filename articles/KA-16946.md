A client workflow that generate reports does not generate report anymore because a user that has let the company has been disabled. Upon disabling the user from the campaign classic in access management, the workflow still shows an error. Upon enabling the user, they can use the workflow. Why did it stop once the user is disabled and how to keep it working once the user is disabled?

 Is there is any other way to remove the user and allow the client can use the workflow?





Solution --

Whenever you face this error,

1. Open the workflow.
2. Click on Edit  Edit XML source …
3. Search for keyword <b>login=”</b>
4. You will find an element in the XML as shown here![](assets/dee6636f-799e-eb11-b1ac-000d3a368466.png)
5. In your case login will be having some value<b>.</b>
6. Empty the login attribute to make it <b>login=””</b>
7. Click on <b>Ok </b>to close the popup window.
8. Save the workflow.
9. Restart the workflow. If the workflow is part of a Campaign (which will be the case in 99% of cases), ask the relevant user on customer side to restart this workflow using their ID, from inside the Campaign and not from Workflow folder.
10. It should be fixed.
11. Later you can go to Workflows View folder and search <b>*mdata contains login=”username”</b>* to search for other such workflows which might be impacted.
12. Repeat the above steps for each one.


Hope this helps.
