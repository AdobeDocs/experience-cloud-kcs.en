# Unable to edit branding configuration in ACS


The article provides a solution for the Campaign Standard issue, where you cannot edit the branding configuration in ACS. You might need to check if you are assigned to the <b>Access to the deliverability parameters</b> security group, and get assigned if you are not.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Standard

### Issue/Symptoms

You are unable to edit the branding configuration in Adobe Campaign Standard.


## Resolution {#resolution}


To edit brand configuration, access to the <b>Administrators</b> security group is not enough

Check your access on the instance under the path: <b>Administration </b>`>`  <b>Users</b> and <b>Security </b>`>`  <b>Users</b>. Under security groups, ensure that you are assigned to the <b>Access to the deliverability parameters</b> security group.
