2. Launch the "Adobe Experience Platform Debugger" and check that Summary information is displayed.
3. Log in to "Adobe Experience Platform Debugger" from the Sign link in at the top.
4. Click "Experience Platform Tags Configuration".
5. Click “… Action Replace” on Page Embed Code.
6. Select Property and Environment.


With the above method, you can easily convert the embed code without entering the embed code directly.
