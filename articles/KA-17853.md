# External API Activity Support

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
Content Standard


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
The third-party REST API endpoint accepts the following JSON format to pass the data.

<b>Actual Payload</b>:

`{"destination":"https://www.google.com/work/insights/123","domain":"google.com"}`



But ACS modifies the JSON format, which is not accepted by the third-party REST API endpoint.

<b>Modified Payload</b>:

`{“data”:{"destination":"https://www.google.com/work/insights/123","domain":"google.com"}}`




## Resolution {#resolution}




There are two factors that influenced the decision to use the format:

1. The *data* portion is only added if there is an inbound *temp table*generated by previous activity, and the rows from that *temp table*are serialized into a *JSON* array. Hence the need for a *JSON* property named *data* and the serialized data sent as an array using .
2. The activity allows custom parameters to be sent to the API as well, which are added to the payload using a *params* property. Note that these are fixed (configured once into the activity during authoring time).




This normalized format allowed us to have a fixed format without any UI support to customize how to format this according to third-party API specs. The intention was to use a translation layer, such as Adobe IO Runtime, AWS Lambda, etc., to do on-the-fly translation of requests/responses as needed.
