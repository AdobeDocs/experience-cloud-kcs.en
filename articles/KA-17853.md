# External API Activity Support


This article explains the issue where Adobe Campaign Standard modifies the JSON format that the third-party REST API endpoint cannot accept.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Campaign Standard (ACS)

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

The third-party REST API endpoint accepts the following JSON format to pass the data.

<b>Actual Payload</b>:

`{"destination":"https://www.google.com/work/insights/123","domain":"google.com"}`



But ACS modifies the JSON format, which is not accepted by the third-party REST API endpoint.

<b>Modified Payload</b>:

`{“data”:[ {"destination":"https://www.google.com/work/insights/123","domain":"google.com"}] }`




## Resolution {#resolution}


There are two factors that influenced the decision to use the format:

1. The *data* portion is only added if there is an inbound *temp table*generated by previous activity, and the rows from that *temp table*are serialized into a *JSON* array. Hence the need for a *JSON* property named *data* and the serialized data sent as an array using `[` `]` .
2. The activity allows custom parameters to be sent to the API as well, which are added to the payload using a *params* property. Note that these are fixed (configured once into the activity during authoring time).


This normalized format allowed us to have a fixed format without any UI support to customize how to format this according to third-party API specs. The intention was to use a translation layer, such as Adobe IO Runtime, AWS Lambda, etc., to do on-the-fly translation of requests/responses as needed.
