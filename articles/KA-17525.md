# Solutions for the Chrome unsandbox access denied error in Flash

## Description


When you play Adobe Access stream in Google Chrome, you experience a DRM Error: 3321: i15nFailed when you deny the security banner for Flash Player.

<b>Note: </b>In newer versions of the Google Chrome, a more specific DRM Error: 3368: [!DNL UserSettingsNoAccess] appears if you click the [!UICONTROL Deny] button in the security banner.


## Resolution


Before playing protected content, Flash performs some operations that cannot be performed from within Chrome’s Sandbox. Trying to perform operations outside the sandbox triggers Chrome to present the info bar. It's necessary to click [!UICONTROL Allow] to proceed.

If you denied the security question, then it could be necessary to refresh the browser or allow the access using following steps in Chrome.
