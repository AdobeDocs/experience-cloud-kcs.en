# Copying Experience Fragment from One Sub-folder to Another


This page provides an explanation on how to copy experience fragment from one sub-folder to another.

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
Adobe Experience Manager

<b>Issue</b>
There is a folder (For example: *myfolder*) under the path of `/content/experience-fragments`, and from the <b>Experience Fragment</b> properties console, custom Experience Fragment template have been added under the <b>Allowed Template</b> property.
Now when trying to copy/move an experience fragment from one sub-folder *test-1* to another sub-folder *test-2*, an error will be shown in the GUI console and the paste/move operation fails with a similar error:


```
/content/experience-fragments/_1/_1_1/test-xf (Experience Fragment Template) not allowed below /content/experience-fragments/_1/test-xf
```



## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Solution</b>
In order to enable to copy/move operation on the sub-folders one more path needs to be added under the `cq:allowedTemplates` property of the parent folder `/libs/cq/experience-fragments/components/experiencefragment/template`.
This is because the copy/move operation is tightly coupled with default experience fragment components at path `/libs/cq/experience-fragments/components/experiencefragment/template`.
