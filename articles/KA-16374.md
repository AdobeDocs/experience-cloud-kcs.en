# Limit scheduler process email sends to weekdays | Campaign Standard

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Campaign Standard



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

The scheduler sends emails several times daily, seven days a week. Need to have the scheduler send emails on weekdays only.


## Resolution {#resolution}

<b>Steps to Resolve/Workaround</b>
1. Create an option to be used in the workflow
2. Schedule your workflow as it is today
3. Query the options previously created and add the day in the week of the current date as additional data
4. Add a segmentation activity using the temporary entity (previous query activity) that checks whether the week of the day is a weekday.
5. If it is a weekday, continue in the Complement section of the Segmentation activity, and use an End activity.
