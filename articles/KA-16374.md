## Resolution {#resolution}

Steps to Resolve/Workaround
1. Create an option to be used in the workflow, next step
2. Schedule your workflow as it is today
3. Query the options previously created and add the day in the week of the current date as additional data
4. Add a segmentation activity using the temporary entity (previous query activity) that checks whether the week of the day is a weekday.
5. If it is a weekday, continue in the Complement section of the Segmentation activity, use an End activity.
