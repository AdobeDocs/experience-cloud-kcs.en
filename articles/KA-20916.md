# Adobe Analytics: workspace and data feed page views differ

## Description {#description}


This article provides a best practice for isolating the reason for discrepancies between data feeds and Analysis Workspace and other reporting tools.

<b>Environment</b>

- Adobe Analytics


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>


For example, you see that the count of page views between an Analysis Workspace report and a corresponding data feed do not match.




## Resolution {#resolution}


When there are discrepancies between data feeds and any of the reporting environments that use analytics data, first check your processing rules. Processing rules are defined under the <b>Admin</b> tab within the Analytics interface.

Example:
A processing rule that populates the `post_page_name` variable on non-page view events (link click, download link, etc.) will cause that event to be reported as a traditional page view. You have overridden the default behavior.  To learn more about default rules, refer to [Processing Rules](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/admin-tools/processing-rules/processing-rules-configuration/processing-rules-about.html?lang=en) in the Analytics Admin guide.
