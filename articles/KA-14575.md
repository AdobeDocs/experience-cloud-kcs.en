# Campaign Standard: Intermittent 400 failures for "[!UICONTROL KPIs Reconciliation with Adobe Analytics]" workflow

## Description


It has been reported an issue with the  technical workflow "[!UICONTROL KPIs Reconciliation with Adobe Analytics]" is intermittently hitting the 400 error below:
```
API call to Adobe Analytics failed - 
Url: [https://api.omniture.com/admin/1.4/rest/?method=Report.Get](https://api.omniture.com/admin/1.4/rest/?method=Report.Get "Follow link") 
Request body : {"reportID":2033917055} Response: 400 Error: {"error":"report_not_ready","error_description":"Report not ready","error_uri":null}
```

## Resolution


After verification with [!DNL Analytics] support, the warning message is expected sporadically. Basically, the message means the [!DNL Analytics] report is still processing, inferring that the [!DNL Campaign] should try later. It is possible that occasionally the report takes a long time to run or the data is latent.
