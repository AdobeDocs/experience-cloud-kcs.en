# 400 errors for "KPIs Reconciliation with Adobe Analytics" workflow

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Campaign Standard

<b>Issue</b>
 The technical workflow <b>KPIs Reconciliation with Adobe Analytics</b> intermittently hits the 400 error similar to the error below:
`API call to Adobe Analytics failed - Url: https://api.omniture.com/admin/1.4/rest/?method=Report.Get Request body : {"reportID":2033917055} Response: 400 Error: {"error":"report_not_ready","error_description":"Report not ready","error_uri":null}`

## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Solution</b>
After verification with Analytics support, the warning message is expected sporadically.

Basically, the message means the Analytics report is still processing, inferring that the Campaign should try later.

It is possible that occasionally the report takes a long time to run, or the data is latent.
