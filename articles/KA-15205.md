# Campaign Classic - How to align the timezone of a workflow to that of the operator?

## Description


How to align the timezone of a workflow to that of the operator?


## Resolution


You can change the timezone of a workflow by going to the properties of the workflow and there you need to select operator timezone which would align the workflow execution per operator timezone.

 By default, the timezone of a workflow is set to default, i.e. the server timezone.

You can simply choose the operator timezone from the drop-down list.

 To avoid defining the timezone every time in a workflow, you can create a workflow template with the desired timezone and you can use this template for creating any new workflow.
