<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
How to align the timezone of a workflow to that of the operator?


## Resolution




By default, the timezone of a workflow is set to default, i.e., the server timezone.



You can choose the operator timezone from the drop-down list. To avoid defining the timezone every time in a workflow, you can create a workflow template with the desired timezone and use this template for creating any new workflow.



To change the timezone of a workflow, follow this step.



Go to <b>Properties </b>of the workflow and select <b>Operator Timezone</b>. It would align the workflow execution as per the operator's timezone.
