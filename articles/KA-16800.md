# Number of Unique Visitors are different in [!UICONTROL Cohort table]

## Description


During the calculation of the retention rate data by using a [!UICONTROL Cohort table], after applying the segment with additional conditions, it results in the column included changes and become different than in the [!UICONTROL Freeform table].

## Resolution


This is because because Date Ranges are used as dimensions, which restrict the scope of the segment to that date range only. Whereas in [!UICONTROL Cohort], it takes into account complete date range, say last 5 months

We can verify by creating a segment by right clicking on any cell in the [!UICONTROL Cohort table]. So, if we just create a segment from the current month cell in [!UICONTROL Cohort] and just change the date range in the report, we will the numbers matching.

This is equivalent to applying purple colored date range as dimension because the date range is restricting to the report date range. However, if we just change the date range to last 5 months, you will see that the numbers exactly match the [!UICONTROL Cohort table].
