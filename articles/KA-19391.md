# Template HTML applying URI encoding after saving

## Description


Errors on while using fragments and templates, where tags seem to be URI encoded after saving.

Characters such as & will change into &amp;,  into &lt; and into &gt;. This issue occurred because the meta tags were added within the body tag.


## Resolution


`META` tag has to be added in the header, not the body. `META` tags are only allowed within `HEAD` (like, say, `TITLE`), so you're creating an invalid markup by putting it into a `BODY`.



<b>Fix</b> - Removed all elements of header information, meta tags, and CSS from fragments.

<b>Explanation</b>: When these items are saved within an ACS fragment, ACS adds a new header and pushes the meta tags, titles, etc., outside the header code. At a later stage, when you save the fragment/template, ACS parses the HTML and attempts to clean it by applying URI encoding to what it thinks are text values for display. This ultimately changes some of the codings, so it can't render as expected.

<b>Simple fix</b> - keep all fragments as simple as possible, bare-bones HTML within a structure. After creating your final template, you can go into the HTML for it and add additional meta tags and CSS to the header already created by ACS.
