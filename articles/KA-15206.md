How to create a multilingual email templates for Transactional emails in ACS?


## Resolution


Transactional deliveries in ACS work in a slightly different manner.
  
 You need to add an attribute "<b>AC_language</b>", and next when you send your event, this attribute will contain a language code.
  
 As for standard deliveries, in the transactional message, you must initialize your transactional message with the action "Initialize content variant" in transactional message properties.
  
 When a transactional message is generated, you have to define this transactional message as a multi-language template.
  
 To do that, like for marketing deliveries, in main properties of transactional message you must click on "initialize content variant".
  
 This action will "add" multilanguage behavior to this transactional message.
  
 Next, you update different content variants exactly like in a marketing delivery.
