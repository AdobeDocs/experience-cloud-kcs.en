# Property is not getting populated automatically when creating an activity in [!DNL Target]

## Description


Recently started using Adobe Launch and when creating an activity in Adobe Target, the respective property is not getting populated within [!DNL Target] UI automatically


## Resolution


Please follow below steps to ensure that the property is detected inside VEC as well as sent in mbox call. Here are the steps -

- Create Property in [!DNL Launch]
- Create a new [!UICONTROL Data Element] as `at_property` and add value of your property. (Make sure that name of data element is `at_property`). Select [!UICONTROL Extension] as [!UICONTROL Core] and  data Element Type as [!UICONTROL Custom Code].
- Create a new Rule and ensure that order of Actions is  <u>Adobe Target-Load Target THEN Adobe Target- Add Params to Global mbox THEN <b>Core-Custom Code</b> THEN Adobe Target - Fire Global mbox</u>
- Create library and include above data element & rule.
