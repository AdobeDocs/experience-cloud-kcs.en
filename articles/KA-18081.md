# What is the maximum number of bytes that can be used in the "Name" fields in the "Traffic / Conversion Classification"?

## Description

I will set the "Name (name of the classification)" field in the traffic/conversion classification to a value of a length that has never been set before. Is there a limit to the number of bytes in this case?<br><br> <br><br>・Traffic classifications

## Resolution


The value entered in the "Name" field is limited to 100 bytes. Values exceeding 101 bytes or more are truncated. Note that multibyte characters may be garbled, and settings will not be reflected.
