# What is the maximum number of bytes that can be used in the "Name" fields in the "[!UICONTROL Traffic Classifications] / [!UICONTROL Conversion Classifications]"?

## Description

I will set the "[!UICONTROL Name] (name of the classification)" field in the traffic/conversion classification to a value of a length that has never been set before. Is there a limit to the number of bytes in this case?<br><br> <br><br>・[!UICONTROL Traffic Classifications]

## Resolution


The value entered in the "[!UICONTROL Name]" field is limited to 100 bytes. Values exceeding 101 bytes or more are truncated. Note that multibyte characters may be garbled, and settings will not be reflected.
