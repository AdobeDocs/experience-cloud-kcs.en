# Recommendation is filtering the criteria while creating the activity, even if the activity URL has entity/categoryID

## Description


<b>Receiving a warning message when applying a specific criteria to an activity, even if everything is configured correctly:</b>
 The pages in the activity are passing the parameters required by the criteria (entity.id and entity.categoryId) in mbox call 



 However,  still getting below message when applying the required criteria to the activity

 "An entity.ategoryID is required for this criteria to work properly. Use it anyway?"


## Resolution


<b>Sometimes the activity builder doesn't correctly "pick up" that the page is tagged with entity.id and entity.categoryId and still displays the warning message.</b>



You can turn OFF the filtering at account level from recommendation settings as below

![](http://omniture.custhelp.com/ci/inlineImage/get/3041012/5090ecb0bec7673ef3ad943bd35f9095)



Activity content delivery is not restricted in any manner with this configuration.



This filtration is only used to create the activity but would not affect the algorithm in any way.
