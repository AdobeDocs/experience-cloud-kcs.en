# Recommendation is filtering criteria while creating activity

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Target

<b>Issue</b>
 Receive a warning message when applying a specific criteria to an activity, even if everything is configured correctly:
 The pages in the activity are passing the parameters required by the criteria (`entity.id` and `entity.categoryId`) in the mbox call.

However, the error message below still appears when applying the required criteria to the activity:


```
An entity.ategoryID is required for this criteria to work properly. Use it anyway?
```


<b>Cause</b>
 Sometimes the activity builder doesn't correctly "pick up" that the page is tagged with `entity.id` and `entity.categoryId` and still displays the warning message.




## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>
You can turn OFF the filtering at account level from recommendation settings as below:

![](http://omniture.custhelp.com/ci/inlineImage/get/3041012/5090ecb0bec7673ef3ad943bd35f9095)

Activity content delivery is not restricted in any manner with this configuration.

This filtration is only used to create the activity, but would not affect the algorithm in any way.
