# Thumbnails not appearing in the Recommendations and items appear in entity variable syntax

## Description


When running a Target Recommendations activity, items are appearing in the entity variable syntax as opposed to values of the entity variables despite seeing that the criteria is "Ready" and there are products in the activity's "Download Data" Excel sheet. In the served recommendations, the thumbnails are also not getting served.


## Resolution


Please ensure that the products which are added in the Recommendations have a valid Page URL, Base URL and Thumbnail URL. Please use mboxDebug to confirm that all recommendations actions are being set as there could be unexpected reference errors that can be seen when attempting to load the entity URLs for these products.
