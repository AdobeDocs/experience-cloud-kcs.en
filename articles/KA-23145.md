# Duplicate purchase IDs causing non-reporting in Adobe Analytics


Explore how duplicate purchase IDs impact Adobe Analytics, preventing order reporting. Learn how proper implementation can resolve this tracking issue.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Analytics

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Non-reporting of orders in Adobe Analytics due to duplicate purchase IDs.

The system mandates a purchase ID for any hit with a purchase event to prevent duplicate purchases and ensure accurate event values. If a purchase ID isn't provided, the system auto-generates one using events and product strings, assuming identical lists imply the same purchase.

Explicitly provided purchase IDs are valid for all report suite visitors, expiring after 37 months. Conversely, system-generated IDs are visitor-specific, expiring after 24 hours, with only the last 5 IDs retained. The same auto-generated ID can exist for multiple visitors within the report suite, as they are visitor-specific, not report suite-specific.
