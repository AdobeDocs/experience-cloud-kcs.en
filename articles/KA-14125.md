# Modifying the Environment  of one Recommendation Collection modifies other Collections

## Description

Issue/Symptoms<br>
- Changing the environment of one collection changes the other collection(s) in the same environment



Environment
- Multiple environments, i.e. Development and Staging
- Two or more collectionsÂ  under [!UICONTROL Recommendations] - [!UICONTROL Collections]
- Collections are both in the same Environment



## Resolution


Cause

This behavior is by design. The environment setting is used to give a preview of the entities present in the catalog for that environment. The configuration sticks to the last selected option when moving from one collection to another in the UI.
