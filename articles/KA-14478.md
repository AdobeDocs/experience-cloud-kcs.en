# Content fragment duplicates itself in the Email Designer in ACS


This article addresses the Campaign Standard issue where a content fragment duplicates itself in the Email Designer. To resolve this, you may need to recreate the fragment from scratch.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Campaign Standard

### <b>Issue</b>

When opening a delivery in the Email Designer, which has a header included (content fragment), the header duplicates itself.


## Resolution {#resolution}


This issue can occur when a nested fragment is present in the HTML.

It can occur when creating a template, inserting a fragment, and changing the template flag into a fragment one, and this is not supported by the editor.

To solve this, recreate the content fragment from scratch, or remove the nested fragment manually.
