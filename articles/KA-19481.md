# Launcher for "[!UICONTROL DAM Set last modified date]" workflow launcher does not work after latest AEMaaCS update

## Description


After the latest AEM as cloud SDK update ( 2022.4.7138.20220427T075748Z ) a custom launcher for the "DAM Set last modified date" workflow launcher is not triggered.

 Months ago the customer created a workflow launcher to update the last modified date to assets into a particular folder when the user changes any metadata.
 Their launcher is a copy of the standard one but, of course, it was created under `/conf` folder and not `/libs`.

 After the latest SDK upgrade, the launcher is no longer running.


## Resolution


The customer provided a package with the launcher created by them which runs the "[!UICONTROL DAM Set last modified date]" workflow on a custom assets folder.

The issue was reproducible in a test AEMaaCS environment following the next steps:

1. Install the package provided by the customer

2. Create the same folder structure as the one used by the customer in AEM - Assets

3. Add assets to the previously created folder

4. Modify any metadata (e.g. Title) of an asset in the specified folder

Expected behavior: the `jcr:LastModified` - Date should be updated

Experienced behavior: the `jcr:LastModified` - Date is not changed



<u>Resolution</u>

In AEM as a Cloud Service, the "[!UICONTROL DAM Set last modified date]" Launcher, has the following flag enabled: “[!UICONTROL This Feature Flag would govern the AEM Assets Nui integration Feature. This Flag would only be enabled if Nui is enabled otherwise it returns false.] (`com.adobe.dam.asset.nui.feature.flag`)”.

After removing the flag, the launcher works as expected.
