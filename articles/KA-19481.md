# Launcher error for "DAM Set last modified date" workflow after update


Remove the <b>`com.adobe.dam.asset.nui.feature.flag `</b>flag, and the launcher works as expected.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)

### <b>Issue</b>

After the latest AEM as cloud SDK update ( 2022.4.7138.20220427T075748Z ) a custom launcher for the <b>DAM Set last modified date</b> workflow launcher is not triggered.

 A workflow launcher was created to update the last modified date to assets into a particular folder when the user changes any metadata. The launcher is a copy of the standard one, but it was created under `/conf` folder and not `/libs`.

 After the latest SDK upgrade, the launcher is no longer running.

<u>Prerequisites</u>:

A package with the created launcher, which runs the <b>DAM Set last modified date</b> workflow on a custom assets folder in an <b>AEMaaCS</b> environment.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Install the package created by your customer.

2. Create the same folder structure as the one used by your customer in <b>AEM - Assets</b>.

3. Add assets to the previously created folder.

4. Modify any metadata (Example: *Title*) of an asset in the specified folder.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The `jcr:LastModified` date should be updated.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The `jcr:LastModified` date is not changed.


## Resolution {#resolution}


In AEM as a cloud service, the <b>DAM Set last modified date</b> launcher has the <b>`com.adobe.dam.asset.nui.feature.flag`</b> flag <b>Enabled</b>.

“This Feature Flag would govern the AEM Assets Nui integration Feature. This Flag would only be enabled if Nui is enabled otherwise it returns false. (`com.adobe.dam.asset.nui.feature.flag`).”

After removing the flag, the launcher works as expected.
