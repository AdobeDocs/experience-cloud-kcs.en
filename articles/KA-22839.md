# Adobe Experience Manager: Permissions disappear unexpectedly in AEM as a Cloud Service

## Description {#description}


Permissions granted to a user in AEM as a Cloud Service may unexpectedly disappear, resulting in the following symptoms:
 - Contents are no longer visible
 - Publish button is no longer available

This article explains how to deal with this problem.

<b>Environment</b>
 AEM as a Cloud Service



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Groups created in Admin Console (IMS groups) are synchronized to AEM and treated as groups on AEM. Unlike groups created on AEM (AEM local groups), the IMS group must not be modified on AEM. The changes to the IMS group may get reset unintentionally, which leads to permission issues.

Examples of changes that cause problems:
 - Include an AEM local group or a user as a member of an IMS group
 - Create a nested structure between IMS groups


## Resolution {#resolution}


Follow steps 1 to 3 to configure users and groups:

Step 1. Add IMS users to new or existing IMS groups using the Admin Console

Step 2. Add IMS groups as a member of AEM local groups

AEM built-in groups
｜- AEM local group
 ｜- IMS group
  ｜- IMS user

Step 3. Set permissions on AEM local groups
