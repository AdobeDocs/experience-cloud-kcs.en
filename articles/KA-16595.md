# OOTB way to export DAM asset to Target

## Description

Is there any OOTB way to export DAM assets from AEM to [!DNL Target?]<br><br><br>

## Resolution


There is no OOTB option to export assets to Target. Only XF can be exported to Target.



As [!DNL AEM] should be your centralised DAM, it is ideal to host assets in [!DNL AEM] and use the Link of the asset to replace an asset in [!DNL target] to avoid duplication in multiple sources.
