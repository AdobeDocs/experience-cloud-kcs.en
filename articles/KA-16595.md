# OOTB way to export DAM asset to Target

## Description

<br>Environment<br><br>
Target
<br><br>Issue/Symptoms<br><br>Is there any Out-of-the-box (OOTB) way to export Digital Asset Management (DAM) assets from Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) to Target?<br>

## Resolution


There is no Out-of-the-box (OOTB) option to export assets to Target. Only Experience Fragments (XF) can be exported to Target.

As Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) should be your centralized Digital Asset Management (DAM), it is ideal to host assets in AEM and use the link of the asset to replace an asset in Target to avoid the duplication in multiple sources.
