## Resolution {#resolution}


Preliminary checks:

1. <b>Query Parameters</b>

    Check that website allows query parameter. The VEC automatically appends the following query parameters to the page URL:mboxEdit=1 & mboxDisable=1. Open the website in a separate tab and append at the end the above query parameters and observe if there is any issue. If your website is: `www.customerwebsite.com`, then open a new tab and check: `www.customerwebsite.com?mboxEdit=1&mboxDisable=1`
2. <b>Mixed Content should be allowed</b>

    In case you are using custom active content like JavaScript and CSS files, these should be downloaded over HTTPS and not HTTP.

    Reference Document [Enabling mixed content in your browser](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/experiences/vec/troubleshoot-composer/mixed-content.html?lang=en)
3. <b>The webpage should be accessible within an iframe.</b> Check if the website supports iframe or blocks them by going to [jsbin](https://jsbin.com/) and paste below code. See if the website opens in an iframe. Replace facebook.com with the website URL.

    

    


    ```
    !DOCTYPE html    html    head    meta charset="utf-8"     meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"      titleJS Bin/title     /head    body       iframe src="https://www.facebook.com" height="700";width="850"/iframe    /body    /html
    ```



    
4. There could be one or multiple iframe busting techniques used, few of which are listed below:
    - X-Frame-Options header
    - X-Frame-Options: [X-Frame-Options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options)
    - This header can be removed if needed via Requestly (Chrome Extension) as described on public the documentation: [Troubleshooting issues related to the Visual Experience Composer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/experiences/vec/troubleshoot-composer/troubleshooting-issues-related-to-the-visual-experience-composer-vec.html?lang=en)
5. JS Based Iframe Busting. This can be done through various JavaScript code.
    - A basic example: 

        ```
        script
        if(top != window) {
           body.style.display = none;    
        }
        /script
        ```

There are plenty of other JavaScript iFrame Busting techniques and can be seen the most used on this link: [Busting Frame Busting](https://seclab.stanford.edu/websec/framebusting/framebust.pdf)


- <b>Following Target JS scripts are downloaded</b>

    - `target-vec.js`
    - `target-vec-helper.js`
- <b>If the DOM structure has changed there could be errors in VEC where configured modifications are not visible in VEC.</b>

    Figure out the Selector for which action is broken: In Console, you can check using:` _AT.querySelectorAll('<selector>')`

    Reference Document for selector configuration: https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/experiences/vec/vec-selectors.html
- <b>Handle duplicate Ids on the page:</b>

    As Target uses selectors of the page to create and deliver recommendations, so it is essential to ensure that the page is a compiant to the below points:

    - Use Classes
    - Use unique attributes present in the elements
    - Check if the selector matches the Unique element
    - Remove dynamic classNames from selectors like active, selected, etc.


<b>Please make sure elements are not contained within an iframe itself, as VEC loads content in an iframe so iframe within a parent iframe would not work.</b>

<b>Common issues: </b>

1. Unable to log in to Online Banking in VEC to perform HTML edit
    - Adobe Target VEC requires the VEC helper extension to load the page.
    - Allow insecure content from the site settings.
    - Set the EEC as disabled.
    - Navigate to the page in VEC using "*Browse mode*"
    - Click <b>Compose</b> to do the changes.
2. Trigger views are not available within VEC to create modifications

    - The page may be using service workers which would not allow trigger views to be available. Here are the steps to work around this scenario:

        - After loading the page in VEC, make sure to disable EEC from Page Delivery, disable service workers, and enable both options in the VEC Helper Extension: Inject Target Libraries and Cookies.
        - Click <b>Browse</b> and click <b>Accept Cookies</b>.
        - Click in the address bar from the VEC page and press <b>Enter</b> so that the page refreshes properly within VEC. View names should show up including in the overlay.
        - Ensure that the *Trigger Views* function is consistently firing on the page. Views will be available only when the *Trigger Views* function fires.
3. Unable to access authorized pages within VEC

    - Access the authorized page in a browser outside VEC. Then access the page in Target, in the <b>New Browser</b> tab of the same window.
4. Unable to access the page using Shadow DOM within Target VEC

    - Ensure that the page is using the latest target library
    - Ensure that all the web components are loaded before the page is accessed in VEC
5. Unable to accept cookies and browse the website within VEC

    - Access the cookies browser outside VEC. Then access the page in Target, in the <b>New Browser</b> tab of the same window.
