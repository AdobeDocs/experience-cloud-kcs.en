# Campaign Classic: quotation mark « » replaced by " " in email content

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Campaign Classic
 Adobe Campaign

<b>Issue</b>
 When an email is sent that contains the quotation marks « » used for the several European languages (French, German, Danish, etc.), the user that receives the email sees English quotation marks " " instead of the quotation marks « » used in many European languages.

The preview of the email's delivery displays the same behavior.
<br><br><br> <br><br>Steps to reproduce:<br><br>1. Go to AC interface and create a new delivery.<br><br>2. Put the « » characters in the content of the delivery.<br><br>3. Click on preview of the delivery to see that the « » are replaced with " ".<br><br>4. Send the email to a user.<br><br>5. Observe that also in the email content the « » are replaced by " ".<br>

## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>
Replace the « » quotation marks with escape codes <b>&laquo;</b> and <b>&raquo;</b> to have the quotation marks (« ») render correctly in both delivered emails and their previews of delivery.
