# mcSync workflows fails with deadlock error


In Adobe Campaign Classic v7, when the mcSync workflow fails with a deadlock error, modify the scheduler in the mcSync workflow to run at different times.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Campaign Classic v7



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

On a marketing instance connected to multiple RT instances, the mcSync workflow fails sometimes with the following error:

`PGS-220000 PostgreSQL error: ERROR: deadlock detected\nDETAIL: Process 10448 waits for ShareLock on transaction 282600426; blocked by process 10446.\nProcess 10446 waits for ShareLock on transaction 282600424; blocked by process 10448.\nHINT: See server log for query details.\nCONTEXT: while updating tuple (56876,3) in relation "nmsdelivery"\n. (iRc=-2006)`


## Resolution {#resolution}


Modify the scheduler in the mcSync workflows so that they run at different times.
<b>Cause</b>
The error occurs because the mcSync workflows are scheduled to run at the same time.
