# Import Error Relation 0 is not currently set up to import data

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Customer Journey Analytics
- Analytics



<b>Issues/Symptoms</b>
What is the reason for the API import error "Relation 0 is not currently set up to import data" in Classifications (SAINT) API?


## Resolution


The error "Relation 0 is not currently set up to import data" is seen when the variable "product" is used with the *upper case* "Product". Classifications API will only accept the variable with 'p' in the *lower case* as "product".
