# Missing Index Manager on AEMaaCS


Environment: AEM as a Cloud Service

## Description {#description}


On AEM Managed Services and AEM on-premise the Index Manager is used to check sizes or statuses for indexes.

Is there an option for this also on AEMaaCS?


## Resolution {#resolution}


Index management in Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service (AEMaaCS) differs significantly from previous versions of AEM.

Here are the essential points:

- Users do not have access to the Index Manager of a single AEM Instance to debug, configure, or maintain indexing anymore.
- All related metrics, including search performance in production, are available for customers at runtime to provide a holistic view of the topics of Search and Indexing.
- Index configuration changes are made via deployments, they are configured like other content changes.
- With the introduction of the rolling deployment model, two sets of indexes exist one for the old version and one for the new version.
- Currently, index management on AEMaaCS is only supported for indexes of type Lucene. - Â Custom analyzers are not supported.


More details about index management details can be found in the Content Search and Indexing documentation - `[` 1`]` .

For details about Oak Indexes, the Oak Indexes status dump from the environment's Developer console can also be used - `[` 2`]`
