# Killing process using shell activity command if stopping it in console doesn't work


You are unable to stop a workflow using the console or unconditional stop. Learn how to stop the workflow for on-premises and on-cloud instances.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

- Campaign Classic
- Campaign
- Campaign Classic v7


### Issue/Symptoms

You want to stop a workflow because it is transferring the files to the server. But the process can't stop even though it is stopped from Campaign Client Console.
 
 <b>Note</b>: *Unconditional stop* has also been tried but doesn't work.


## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>To stop the workflow on On-premises instances, follow these steps:</b>

- Instance restart would kill all the processes.
- If the instance can't be restarted owing to the critical data loss, then check the `runwf` server using the `ps -edf |grep runwf` command and check any process running.


Then confirm the process PID and kill it.

<b>For On-cloud instances:</b>

Contact Adobe Support as you will not have access to the back end of the application.
