# AEP - Why is my segment seeing no profiles when [!DNL Query Service] see some data for the same time and dates?

## Description


Why is my segment seeing no profiles when [!DNL Query Service] see some data for the same time and dates?


## Resolution


While this may not be the case for every ticket, anÂ investigation may indicate the dataset was enabled and disabled (for [!DNL Profile)] at times and this would explain why some timeframes are gathering data and some not.

Note that the segment estimate would only show you what was ingested in [!DNL Profile] as opposed to [!DNL Query Service] only looking into the [!DNL Data Lake], this would explain the discrepancy. If some data was ingested into the Data Lake at a point in time where the dataset was NOT enabled for [!DNL Profile], the data wouldn't have been promoted to the Unified Profile Service (UPS).



Also note you may be able (with the correct permissions) to access the [!UICONTROL Audit Logs] feature in AEP where you would potentially see the historical data we have for a dataset.

This requires the '<b>*View User Activity Log access</b>*' control permission granted in <b>Data Governance</b>. - See Admin Console
