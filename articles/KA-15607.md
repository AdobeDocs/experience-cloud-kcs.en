# Link Checker marking otherwise working URLs as invalid

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Experience Manager 6.5

<b>Issue</b>
 Link Checker marks working URLs as invalid.
 So the links the pages appear as broken.
 AEM Link Checker is gets a 404 error response when attempting to connect to the specific URLs, which are otherwise working. The 404 error message will look similar to this:


```
20.05.2020 17:53:07.783 *INFO* sling-default-2-com.day.cq.rewriter.linkchecker.impl.LinkCheckerTask.299567 com.day.cq.rewriter.linkchecker.impl.LinkCheckerTask Checked URL https://abc.xyz.com/def-efg: 404 (invalid)
```




<b>Cause</b>
 If you check these URLs in an online tool (For example: [https://reqbin.com/](https://reqbin.com/)) that can submit `HEAD` requests, and if you get a 404 error response, the Link Checker (from AEM 6.5 onwards) is working as designed.

 Until the AEM 6.4 release, the Link Checker would make both a `HEAD` and `GET` request when validating links.
 This behavior was changed in AEM 6.5 to address a critical security vulnerability (*CQ-4259662 | SSRF* in the Link Checker).
 Hence from AEM 6.5 onwards, the Link Checker will only submit `HEAD` requests.


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>
If you are sure you still want the URLs to be marked as valid, and the links on the pages to work, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to `/system/console/configMgr`.
2. Search for the config: <b>Day CQ Link Checker Service </b>and edit. See the screenshot below:![](https://adobe.sharepoint.com/sites/D365EntAttachments/knowledgearticle/AEM%206-5%20-%20Link%20Checker%20marking%20otherwise%20working%20URLs%20as%20invalid_33E795C65D9EEA11A812000D3A3038A2/LinkChecker_AEM65_image.jpg)
3. Add a regular expression value to the <b>Link Check Override Patterns</b>. The URLs that match this pattern won't be checked by the Link Checker, (but must be a valid URL anyways). Example: `https://abc\.xyz\.com/`.
4. You can also read these articles for more options: [How to disable Link Checker or configure to mark links as valid in AEM](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-cloud-kcs/kbarticles/KA-16563.html?lang=en) in the Knowledge Articles in Adobe Experience League and [AEM Link Checker : Comprehensive Guide](https://experienceleaguecommunities.adobe.com/t5/adobe-experience-manager-blogs/aem-link-checker-comprehensive-guide/ba-p/290779) in the AEM Blog.
