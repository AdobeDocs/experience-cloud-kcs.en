# Campaign Standard: How to concatenate a text string and a date function in the "Output file"


Learn how to concatenate a text string and a date function in the Output file by using a content block created with the formatDate() function.

## Description {#description}


It has been asked if it is possible to concatenate a text string and a date function in the "Output file" of a workflow "Extract file" activity. The use case for this is that the daily file needed to be updated with a specific date and format every day.


## Resolution {#resolution}


To resolve this a content block should be created with the formatDate() function. Below is an example of this method.

`<` %
var now = new Date();


```
var sToDisp = now.getFullYear() + ("0"+(now.getMonth()+1)).slice(-2) + ("0" + now.getDate()).slice(-2);document.write(sToDisp);%>
```


In this content block, the formatDate() is available
Â 
Then in the extraction file activity, open the <b>Edit </b>file name (The pencil icon is on the right side of the file name field) and add a <b>Content block </b>in the file name.
