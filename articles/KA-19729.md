# Assets with Required Metadata Missing Should not be Easily Available

## Description


An uploaded asset requires some metadata (such as title and description). The asset is uploaded asynchronously and marked with a red REQUIRED METADATA MISSING - modification of the page properties is then impossible without putting in the metadata. The asset can be used on the page and published.


## Resolution


`Logged FR #ASSETS-11015 -Â Assets with Required Metadata Missing Should not be Easily Available.`
