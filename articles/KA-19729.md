# Assets with required metadata missing should not be easily available

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Cloud Services

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

An uploaded asset requires some metadata (such as title and description). Without this, the asset is uploaded asynchronously and marked with a red REQUIRED METADATA MISSING.

Modification of the page properties then becomes impossible without putting in the metadata. However, this is not still preventing the asset from being used on the page or from being published.


## Resolution {#resolution}


`Logged FR #ASSETS-11015 -Â Assets with required metadata missing should not be easily available.`
