# Duration of keeping files on storage after data ingestion | AEP

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
Experience Platform


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
How long does Adobe keep files on the storage after data ingestion?

A customer was manually moving old files to archive for backup and then deleting existing files to refresh with new ones.

Once the ingestion is completed, is Adobe archiving those files?


## Resolution {#resolution}

From a Data Lake perspective, customers may access Customer Data in the Data Lake for up to 7 days, solelyÂ to facilitate data onboarding into Real-Time Customer Data Platform (CDP).<br>Adobe's Customer AI Intelligent Service training or scoring will have a lookback of 180 days on that data.
