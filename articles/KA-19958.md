# AEP - How long is Adobe keeping files on storage after data ingestion?

## Description


How long is Adobe keeping files on storage after data ingestion?

 In this instance a customer is manually moving old files to archive for backup and then deleting existing files to refresh with new ones.

Once the ingestion is completed, is Adobe archiving those files?




## Resolution


From a Data Lake perspective, customers may access Customer Data in the Data Lake for up to 7 days solely to facilitate data onboarding into Real-Time CDP.

Customer AI Intelligent Service training or scoring will have a lookback of 180 days on that data.
