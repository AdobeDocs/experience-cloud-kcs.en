# Request headers not being forwarded to JSSP in ACC


When you are sending request headers and if they are returning empty, it means they are not being forwarded to JSSP. Set the header values as mentioned in this article and then try to access them on the same value page.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Campaign Classic



### Issue/Symptoms

Request headers are not being forwarded to JSSP in Adobe Campaign Classic (ACC).

When you doÂ `request.getHeader('Authorization'),` it always returns as empty. This is also true for any other header you send.


## Resolution {#resolution}


This is an expected behavior from Adobe Campaign Classic. Apache strips away non-standard headers on API calls coming into Campaign.

But there is a workaround as follows:

Set the header values like this:

`--cookie 'cookie-name=value; cookie2-name=value, ....'`

And access it on the page like this:

`cookies[ "cookie-name"] .value`
