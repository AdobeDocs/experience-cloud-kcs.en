# Custom field not displaying on form


To solve the issue where the custom field does not display check that the field is on the correct form and the Skip logic configuration.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Workfront

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

A field has been added to a custom form, however, when you look at the form the field is not visible.


## Resolution {#resolution}


To resolve the issue, perform the following steps:

1. Ensure the field is in the correct form.
2. Check for section breaks.

    - If there are section breaks, check the access needed to view fields within the section.                     ![](assets/f585c275-ad15-ee11-8f6e-6045bd006793.png)
3. Check the form for Skip Logic.                                                                                                                                               ![](assets/6067dbce-ad15-ee11-8f6e-6045bd006793.png)
    - When Skip Logic is implemented, the other sections are waiting for that Skip Logic to be initiated which can hide those sections/other fields.
    - There will be an 'S' symbol on the field to signify that a field has Skip Logic.
    - If Skip Logic is hiding the field, users will need to fill out the required fields for the logic to trigger or you may need to reconfigure the logic on your form.
