# Fix Inconsistencies in the repository when SegmentNotFound Issue is reported in AEM 6.x

## Description


Observed SegmentNotFound Exceptions in the logs. For example:

1. \*ERROR\* FelixStartLevel org.apache.sling.event org.apache.sling.event.impl.jobs.queues.QueueManager(1431) The activate method has thrown an exception (org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.plugins.segment.SegmentNotFoundException: Segment da5bcb95-d00a-4c04-a9d9-0f10f2b14e5e not found)
2. \*ERROR\* pool-6-thread-3 org.apache.sling.commons.scheduler.impl.QuartzScheduler Exception during job execution of org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.plugins.index.AsyncIndexUpdate@1dc173f9 : Segment e669f30b-e886-4b7a-b161-56432601ec6b not found


org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.plugins.segment.SegmentNotFoundException: Segment e669f30b-e886-4b7a-b161-56432601ec6b not found

<b>Environment</b>

AEM 6.\*

<b>Cause</b>

Due to some older issues in Oak or some inconsistencies in the repository, a segment can go missing and repository might be inconsistent.


## Resolution


Run consistency check on the repository and find the last good revision healthy state and revert back to it. Please do the following:

1. Download a version of oak-run that matches your oak core version from [https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.jackrabbit/oak-run](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.jackrabbit/oak-run)

2. To revert a corrupt segment store to its latest good state change into CQ's working directory (the one containing the crx-quickstartfolder) and backup all files in ./crx-quickstart/repository/segmentstore/.

3. Run the consistency check,

`java -Xmx6000m -jar oak-run-*.jar check --bin=-1 /path/to/crx-quickstart/repository/segmentstore`



This searches backwards through the revisions until it finds a consistent one:

Look for message like below:

main INFO o.a.j.o.p.s.f.t.ConsistencyChecker - Found latest good revision afdb922d-ba53-4a1b-aa1b-1cb044b535cf:234880



4. Revert the repository to this revision by editing ./crx-quickstart/repository/segmentstore/journal.log and deleting all lines after the line containing the latest good revision.

5. Remove all ./crx-quickstart/repository/segmentstore/\*.bak files.

6. Run checkpoint clean-up to remove orphaned checkpoints:

`java -Xmx6000m -jar oak-run-*.jar checkpoints /path/to/crx-quickstart/repository/segmentstore rm-unreferenced`

7. Finally compact the repository:

`java -Xmx6000m -jar oak-run-*.jar compact /path/to/crx-quickstart/repository/segmentstore/`
