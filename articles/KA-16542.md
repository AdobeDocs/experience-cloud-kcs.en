# Fix inconsistencies in repository when SegmentNotFound reported in AEM 6.x


If you have inconsistencies in the repository (repo) when `SegmentNotFound` reported, run a consistency check on the repo, find the last good revision (healthy state), and revert back to it.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) 6.x



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

The exceptions for `SegmentNotFound` are observed in the logs.

Example:

1. *\*ERROR\* `[` FelixStartLevel`]`  org.apache.sling.event `[` org.apache.sling.event.impl.jobs.queues.QueueManager(1431)`]`  The activate method has thrown an exception (org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.plugins.segment.SegmentNotFoundException: Segment da5bcb95-d00a-4c04-a9d9-0f10f2b14e5e not found)*
2. *\*ERROR\* `[` pool-6-thread-3`]`  org.apache.sling.commons.scheduler.impl.QuartzScheduler Exception during job execution of org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.plugins.index.AsyncIndexUpdate@1dc173f9 : Segment e669f30b-e886-4b7a-b161-56432601ec6b not found

    org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.plugins.segment.SegmentNotFoundException: Segment e669f30b-e886-4b7a-b161-56432601ec6b not found*



## Resolution {#resolution}


Run a consistency check on the repo and find the last good revision (healthy state) and revert back to it.

Follow these steps:

1. Download a version of oak-run that matches your oak core version from [https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.jackrabbit/oak-run](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.jackrabbit/oak-run)
2. To revert a corrupt segment store to its latest good state, change into CQ's working directory (the one containing the crx-quickstartfolder) and back up all files in ./crx-quickstart/repository/segmentstore/.
3. Run the consistency check,

    <b>`java -Xmx6000m -jar oak-run-*.jar check --bin=-1 /path/to/crx-quickstart/repository/segmentstore`</b>

    

    This searches backward through the revisions until it finds a consistent one:

    

    Look for a message like the one below:

    `[` main`]`  INFO o.a.j.o.p.s.f.t.ConsistencyChecker - Found latest good revision afdb922d-ba53-4a1b-aa1b-1cb044b535cf:234880

    
4. Revert the repo to this revision by editing ./crx-quickstart/repository/segmentstore/journal.log and deleting all lines after the line containing the latest good revision.
5. Remove all ./crx-quickstart/repository/segmentstore/\*.bak files.
6. Run checkpoint clean-up to remove orphaned checkpoints:

    <b>`java -Xmx6000m -jar oak-run-*.jar checkpoints /path/to/crx-quickstart/repository/segmentstore rm-unreferenced`</b>

    
7. Finally, compact the repo:

    <b>`java -Xmx6000m -jar oak-run-*.jar compact /path/to/crx-quickstart/repository/segmentstore/`</b>



<b>Cause</b>
Due to some older issues in Oak or some inconsistencies in the repository, a segment can go missing, and the repository might be inconsistent.
