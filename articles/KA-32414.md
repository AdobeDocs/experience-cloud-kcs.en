# Adobe Campaign Standard Content block serach only displays preloaded results

## Description

It has been found in the latest versions of ACS that when attempting to search content blocks within the Dynamic Content Editor, that the search only searches on the initially loaded set of results and not the entire list of available content blocks.

So for example, if the list of content blocks that displays is 20 out of 100 available blocks, the keyword search will only look at the 20 loaded blocks.Â  If one scrolls to the bottom of the list and pre-loads all of the available blocks, the keyword search will search the entire 100 blocks.

## Resolution

Currently there is an enhancement in place (CAMP-41340) for the updated Litmus API to be used in a future release.
