# Does migrating to AEP Web SDK require adjusting d_ or h_ platform keys in AAM traits?

## Description {#description}


When migrating to AEP Web SDK, do the Adobe Audience Manager (AAM) d_ and h_ platform keys in [trait expressions](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/features/traits/trait-variable-prefixes.html?lang=en%29%20used%20for%20Geo%20%28https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/features/traits/trait-geotarget-keys.html?lang=en) used for [Geo](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/features/traits/trait-geotarget-keys.html?lang=en) and [Device](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/features/traits/trait-device-targeting.html?lang=en) targeting need to be updated?


## Resolution {#resolution}


No, they do not need to be updated. These values are based on IP address and Header information that can be found in any network call, regardless of the method used to send data to AAM. The IP and header information are forwarded to AAM from the AEP Edge data collection servers when the Audience Manager service is enabled in the datastream configurator.
