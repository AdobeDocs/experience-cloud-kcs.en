# Campaign Classic - Table not populated in Descriptive analysis

## Description


When we export [!UICONTROL Descriptive] Analysis report, the graph gets exported by the Chart part doesn’t.


## Resolution


Our Engineering Team has accepted this as an Enhancement Request as the report gets extracted correctly if the [!UICONTROL excel] option is used and the chart section is getting exported correctly.

This problem was fixed in the 21.1.4 release (build 9343) and onwards.
