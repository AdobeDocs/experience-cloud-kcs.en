# Campaign Classic - Table not populated in Descriptive analysis

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Campaign Classic

<b>Issue</b>
 When exporting a Descriptive Analysis report, the graph gets exported by the Chart part doesn’t.


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>
The Engineering Team accepted this as an Enhancement Request as the report gets extracted correctly if the Excel option is used and the chart section is getting exported correctly.

This problem was fixed in the 21.1.4 release (build 9343) and onwards.

Release notes are found in this [Latest release](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/release-notes/latest-release.html?lang=en) article in Campaign Classic documentation in Adobe Experience League.
