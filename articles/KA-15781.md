# Campaign Classic - Table not populated in Descriptive analysis


Learn how to solve the Adobe Campaign Classic issue where the graph gets exported but the Chart part doesn’t.

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
Adobe Campaign Classic

<b>Issue</b>
When exporting a Descriptive Analysis report, the graph gets exported but the Chart part doesn’t.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The Engineering Team accepted this as an Enhancement Request as the report gets extracted correctly if the Excel option is used and the chart section is getting exported correctly.

This problem was fixed in the <b>21.1.4 release </b>(build 9343) and onwards.
