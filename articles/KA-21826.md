# How to create an audience of "PC" users in Adobe Target

## Description {#description}

I would like to create an audience of "PC" users only in Adobe Target; how do I set this up?

## Resolution {#resolution}


To specify only "PC" users, connect "Mobile Phone," "Tablet," and "Mobile Device" with the OR operator and set each to False to specify "PC" users. (\* Note that this identification is based on information provided by Device Atlas, so it is recommended that you test in a validation environment before use)
