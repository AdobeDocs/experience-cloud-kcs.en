# Segment not returning expected values in Analytics UI

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Analytics



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

A segment based on the *Referrer* dimension doesn't return expected values when the language of the UI is changed from English to Spanish.



<b>Steps to reproduce:</b>

1. Create a segment based on the "Referrer" dimension such as "Referrer = Typed/Bookmarked"
2. Create any report in Workspace such as Referrer with Visits metric for any date range
3. Apply the above segment. Notice the numbers.
4. Change the language to Spanish
5. Notice the numbers - the numbers change unexpectedly



## Resolution {#resolution}


Use "Referrer Type" - this dimension uses enumerated values as keys in the segment definition that should work consistently across languages.


<b>Cause</b>
The dimension "Referrer" currently uses the exact keyword "Typed/Bookmarked" in English even when the language is changed to Spanish. This is why the data is incorrect.
