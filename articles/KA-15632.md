# "Failed" status while configuring SFTP host in Adobe Launch

## Description


"Failed" status while configuring SFTP host in Adobe Launch.


## Resolution


The most common reason is inappropriate permissions for the given directory for the user.

<u>Steps to validate</u>:

1. Open Chrome’s dev console.
2. Load the Launch UI page (“Edit Host” where the error is seen).
3. Note the server call starting with “HT”.
4. Observe the response.
5. Check if it says: detail: "Net::SFTP::StatusException (8, "op unsupported")"
6. This implies that the user doesn’t have either of the following ability on the directory of the given host: login, create files and folders, delete files and folders (all are mandatory).
