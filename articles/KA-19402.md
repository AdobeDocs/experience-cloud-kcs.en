# List of fragment not displaying in the Email Designer

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign Standard



<b>Issues/Symptoms</b><br>Problem statement - when using the new Email designer, only the OOTB fragment appears in the list of fragments, and when trying to refresh the list, the list loads forever. 

## Resolution {#resolution}


This can happen when a fragment is created using the Legacy Editor. Opening the fragment and saving it via the new editor will update it, and the list will work afterward.
