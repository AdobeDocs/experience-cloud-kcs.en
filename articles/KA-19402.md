# List of fragment not displaying in the Email Designer

## Description

Problem statement - Using the new Email designer, only the OOTB fragment appears in the list of fragments, and when trying to refresh the list, the list loads forever.

## Resolution


This can happen when a fragment is created using the Legacy Editor. Opening the fragment and saving it via the new editor will update it, and the list will work afterward.
