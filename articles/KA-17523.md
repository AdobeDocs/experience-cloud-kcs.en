# MCID cross-domain tracking

## Description

This page illustrates how the [!DNL Marketing Cloud] ID Service maintains a consistent Marketing Cloud ID across domains in a browser that accepts third-party cookies. Some concepts have been simplified for general understanding

## Resolution

<br><br>Steps involved<br><br><br><br><br><br>![Flowchart of steps](https://helpx.adobe.com/marketing-cloud-core/kb/MCID/CrossDomain/jcr%3acontent/main-pars/image.img.png/MCID%20Cross%20Domain.png "Flowchart of steps")
- The user visits a website owned by My Company Inc. for the first time.


- The [!UICONTROL VisitorAPI].js file loads and checks to see if an AMCV cookie exists on the current domain (SiteA.com). No AMCV cookie exists on the current domain, so [!UICONTROL VisitorAPI].js checks to see if a [!DNL demdex].net cookie exists. It does not.


- Since neither cookie exists, a network request is made to [!DNL dpm.demdex.net] with your Marketing Cloud Organization ID (also known as an IMS org ID). In this case, 1234@AdobeOrg is sent with the request.


- The demdex.net server receives the request and generates a UUID. Next, it uses the UUID and IMS org ID (1234) to generate the MID value.


- The server responds to the request from the page with the MID and UUID.


- The VisitorAPI.js library writes the MID to an AMCV cookie in the browser. As part of the response, the demdex server also writes the UUID to a cookie. The AMCV cookie is written on the current domain (SiteA.com) and the demdex cookie is written on the demdex.net domain.


- Page code executes and Adobe solution beacons are fired.


- The user browses to SiteB.com.


- VisitorAPI.js checks to see if an AMCV cookie exists on the current domain (SiteB.com). No AMCV cookie exists on this domain, so Visitor API.js checks to see if a demdex.net cookie exists. It does exist, so the value is retrieved.


- A network request is made to [!DNL dpm.demdex.net] with the IMS org ID (1234) and the UUID value (ABCDE).


- The demdex server generates a MID value using the UUID (ABCDE) and IMS org ID (1234), which were passed in the request.


- The demdex server responds to the request with the MID value (ABC1234).


- The VisitorAPI.js library writes the MID (ABC1234) to an AMCV cookie in the browser. The AMCV cookie is written on the current domain (SiteB.com).


- Page code executes and Adobe solution beacons are fired.
