# Error sending deliveries to recipients not in database

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Campaign Classic v8

<b>Issue</b>
 When attempting to send deliveries to recipients that aren't stored in the database (DB) via an external file, an error is thrown during delivery preparation.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a new delivery.
2. Add <b>Subject</b> and add content as per business requirement.
3. Click “<b>To</b>” and in the main target, choose “*Defined in external File*”.
4. Change Target mapping to *External file* from the dropdown.
5. Click the checkbox "<b>Do not import the </b><b>recipients</b><b> in DB</b>" in order to not import the recipient in the DB.
6. Click <b>File Format </b>Definition. Choose a <b>local file in .csv format</b>. Click the checkbox for <b>Upload file on server</b>. Click <b>Update</b> on the server. Select <b>Transfer Ok</b>. Click <b>Next</b>.
7. In this screen, choose <b>email</b> in the address field from the dropdown. Then click <b>Finish</b>.
8. <b>Save</b> the delivery.
9. Prepare the delivery, and then the following errors will be thrown:

    


    ```
    SOP-330011 Error while executing the method 'PrepareTargetImpl' of service 'nms:delivery'.
    WDB-200001 SQL statement 'DROP TABLE wkDlv_xxxx_Excl' could not be executed.
    ODB-240000 ODBC error: SQL compilation error: Table 'DB_NAME.PUBLIC.WKDLV_xxxx_EXCL' does not exist or not authorized. SQLState: 42S02
    WDB-200001 SQL statement 'ALTER TABLE wkDlv_xxxx RENAME TO wkDlv_xxxx' could not be executed.
    ODB-240000 ODBC error: SQL compilation error: Table 'DB_NAME.PUBLIC.WKDLV_xxxx' does not exist or not authorized. SQLState: 42S02
    DLV-491034 Cannot prepare delivery for tenant xxxx: mid-sourcing service is setup for Full FDA deliveries only.
    ```



## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Workaround</b>
Load the recipients into a separate table on the FFDA database before using this table with specific mapping to send the email messages.

There is no fix available at this time.
