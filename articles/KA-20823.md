# Adobe Experience Manager: pipeline fails at build step due ACL set on non-existent path

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- Adobe Experience Manager

<b>Steps to reproduce:</b>
1. Log in to the Cloud Manager.
2. Download the build log under <b>Build Images</b> for the production pipeline and check for errors.
3. You get the following error message for the Build Image step:Â *Cannot set ACL on non-existent path /content/wknd/us/en/dealer*.



## Resolution {#resolution}


1. Create a path with the correct node types in the same repo init script where you are trying to set Access Control Lists (ACLs).
2. Redeploy.
3. You should see a message in the Cloud Manager that shows the build is complete.


For detailed steps on how to configure your repo init scripts, refer to [Repository-initialization](https://sling.apache.org/documentation/bundles/repository-initialization.html) in Apache documentation.
<b>Cause</b>
Repo init scripts can fail for a number of reasons. One possible reason is that you did not first create the path before you set ACL permissions, or you are trying to perform an action on a nonexisting path.
