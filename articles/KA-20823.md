# Pipeline fails at build step due to ACL set on non-existent path


Learn how to solve the issue where pipeline fails at build step due to ACL set on non-existent path  by configuring the repo init scripts.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager

### Issue/Symptoms 

Pipeline fails at build step due to ACL set on non-existent path.

###  




## Resolution {#resolution}


1. style="list-style-position: inside"`>` Log in to the Cloud Manager.
2. style="list-style-position: inside"`>` Download the build log under <b>Build Images</b> for the production pipeline and check for errors.
3. The following error message occurs for the Build Image step: *Cannot set ACL on non-existent path /content/`<` wknd`>` /us/en/dealer*.


1. `>` Create a path with the correct node type in the same repo init script where you are trying to set Access Control Lists (ACLs).
2. `>` Redeploy.
3. You should see a message in the Cloud Manager that shows the build is complete.


For detailed steps on how to configure the repo init scripts, refer to [Repository-initialization](https://sling.apache.org/documentation/bundles/repository-initialization.html) in Apache documentation.

<b>Cause</b>
Repo init scripts can fail for a number of reasons. One possible reason is that the path before the ACL permissions were not set at first, or an action is being performed on a non-existing path.
