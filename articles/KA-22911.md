# JWT Connection Error for AEM Assets Fusion


If you see a JWT connection error while configuring a connection for AEM Assets as a Cloud Service using the Fusion AEM Assets module, check if the private key is formatted correctly.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

- Adobe Workfront Fusion
- Adobe Experience Manager


### Issue/Symptoms

Configuring the connection for AEM Assets as a Cloud Service using the Fusion AEM Assets module can result in the following error:


```
Failed to verify connection 'My AEM Assets as a Cloud Service connection'. Function 'jwt' finished with error! error:1E08010C:DECODER routines::unsupported.
```


This is typically caused by the private key not being formatted properly.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Follow these steps to resolve the error:

1. Copy the private key in the JSON File downloaded from the Adobe Developer Console and open it in a text editing program.
2. Multiple carriage return characters should be listed in your private key (e.g., \r\n), as shown in the example screenshot below.     ![](assets/3dbe4410-3d5e-ee11-be6f-6045bd006d92.png)
3. Delete all carriage return characters wherever they show in the private key (e.g., \r\n) and replace it with a manual return.
4. Once completed, copy and paste the private key into the AEM Assets configuration module in Fusion alongside the other required information to complete the connection.
