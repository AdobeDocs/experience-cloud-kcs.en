# Trigger view name is not available in Target VEC when creating activity

## Description


Trigger view names are available in [!DNL Target] notification calls on the page, however they are not available within [!DNL Target] VEC while creating the activity. Why?


## Resolution


To troubleshoot such scenarios

1. Ensure that trigger view function (custom code) is fired afterÂ ' Fire Page Load Request' action in Target rule

2. Visit the webpage and ensure that trigger view is available in notification call each time on the activity URL, while navigating through the page.

3. VEC helper extension might be inserting the library which will not load trigger view, so disable the extension to verify

4. SameSite attribute might be affecting the pageload in VEC when using Chrome, resulting into issue. Use other browser like Mozilla to avoid this scenario.
