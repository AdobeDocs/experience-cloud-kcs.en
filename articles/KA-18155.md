# Unable to delete identity namespace

## Description


Issue: I am in the process of setting up the PROD sandbox for \*Blank Company\* . I had noticed there was a few custom identity namespaces created. I know there are apis to create and update a namespace, but it appears the delete request is not allowed.

 curl --location --request DELETE 'https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/idnamespace/identities/10855296' \
 --header 'Authorization: Bearer ' \
 --header 'x-api-key: ccb768e25dd346ab915014845876f828' \
 --header 'x-gw-ims-org-id:\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*'

 how can the whitelist be enabled to delete the namespace which is not used for profile.


## Resolution


We cannot delete identity namespace. It is an Enhancement request which does not release date yet.

The best thing to do right now is to rename them as “do_not_use” or anything which distinguishes it from the others for the architects to identify or to reset the Sandbox.
