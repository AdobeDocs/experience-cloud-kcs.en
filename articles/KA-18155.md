# Unable to delete identity namespace


Learn how to delete identity namespace by renaming it as *do_not_use*or anything which distinguishes it from the others for the architects to identify or reset the Sandbox.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Experience Platform



### <b>Issues/Symptoms</b>

While setting up the PROD sandbox for *Blank Company*, it came to light that were a few custom identity namespaces created. Given the fact that  there are API's to create and update a namespace, it appears that a delete request is not allowed.


```
curl --location --request DELETE 'https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/idnamespace/identities/10855296' \

    --header 'Authorization: Bearer <>' \

    --header 'x-api-key: ccb768e25dd346ab915014845876f828' \

    --header 'x-gw-ims-org-id:<b></b><b></b>*'
```


<br>response<br>

```

    "timestamp": "2022-03-03T13:47:45.800",

    "status": 401,

    "error": "CLIENT_ID_NOT_AUTHORIZED",

    "description": "Client Id not authorized/whitelisted to call Delete API",

    "type": "http://ns.adobe.com/adobecloud/problem/namespacevalidation",

    "title": "Namespace validation",

    "report": {

    "code": "CLIENT_ID_NOT_AUTHORIZED"

    }

    }
```


<br>How can the whitelist be enabled to delete the namespace which is not used for the profile?<br>



## Resolution {#resolution}


Identity namespace cannot be deleted. It is an Enhancement request which does not have a release date yet.

The best thing to do right now is to rename them as *do_not_use*or anything which distinguishes them from the others for the architects to identify or reset the Sandbox.
