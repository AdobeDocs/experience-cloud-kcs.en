# Unable to delete identity namespace

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- Experience Platform



<b>Issues/Symptoms</b>
While setting up the PROD sandbox for \*Blank Company\* , it came to light that were a few custom identity namespaces created. Given the fact that  there are api's to create and update a namespace, it appears that a delete request is not allowed.

   curl --location --request DELETE 'https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/idnamespace/identities/10855296' \
   --header 'Authorization: Bearer ' \
   --header 'x-api-key: ccb768e25dd346ab915014845876f828' \
   --header 'x-gw-ims-org-id:\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*'


   response
   {
   "timestamp": "2022-03-03T13:47:45.800",
   "status": 401,
   "error": "CLIENT_ID_NOT_AUTHORIZED",
   "description": "Client Id not authorized/whitelisted to call Delete API",
   "type": "http://ns.adobe.com/adobecloud/problem/namespacevalidation",
   "title": "Namespace validation",
   "report": {
   "code": "CLIENT_ID_NOT_AUTHORIZED"
   }
   }

   How can the whitelist be enabled to delete the namespace which is not used for the profile.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Identity namespace cannot be deleted. It is an Enhancement request which does not have a release date yet.

The best thing to do right now is to rename them as “do_not_use” or anything which distinguishes it from the others for the architects to identify or to reset the Sandbox.
