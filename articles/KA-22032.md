# About Backup Content that works with Adobe Target's "Criteria Sequence"

## Description {#description}

Q1. I want to use Reccomandation's "Criteria Sequence" to deliver the best content. When using this "Criteria Sequence", how will the "Backup Content (partial design rendering, backup recommendations, inclusion rules)" set individually for each criteria behave?
<br>Q2. Also, what happens if I turn on "Backup Content" that works with "Criteria Sequence"?


## Resolution {#resolution}


A1. When "Criteria Sequence" is used, backup contents set within each condition will not work.

A2. When "Backup Contents" is enabled in "Criteria Sequence", the backup contents of the last criteria will work.
