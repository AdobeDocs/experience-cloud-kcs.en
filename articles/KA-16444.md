# What is a BAVID in Analytics and how are BAVIDs calculated?

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Analytics

<b>Issue</b>
 A BAVID stands for 'Bad Visitor ID'.

The UI (every reporting product (except Data Warehouse and Data Feeds) is susceptible to BAVIDs.
 Starting in early to mid-2020, BAVIDs are being identified and removed from the Adobe Analytics UI.






## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>
BAVID removal is done using the following logic:

- If more than 1% of a report suite's traffic is from the same visitor ID (visid).
- In some cases, if a suite is large, a bad visid can cause problems even though it does not reach the threshold of 1%.

    In such cases, the threshold may be adjusted down to 0.5% to removal of bad visids.
- The percentage is best on a monthly basis--as Analytics data is stored in monthly grain files.


Common reason for a BAVID: populating Visitor IDs with a default visitor ID. Sometimes high bot traffic can also cause BAVIDs. 
Comparing DW or a Data Feed to the UI is a good way to review situations involving BAVIDs.
