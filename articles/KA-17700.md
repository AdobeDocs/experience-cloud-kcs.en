# PDF generation with personalization blocks fails


This article addresses why a workflow and delivery may fail in Campaign Classic when creating a dynamic PDF attachment with personalization blocks. To resolve this, check if the image link is missing `href=.`

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Campaign Classic v7
- Campaign v8


### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

When attempting to create a dynamic PDF attachment that includes personalization blocks, the workflow and delivery may fail.

For reference, refer this [this documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/personalizing-deliveries/generating-personalized-pdf-documents.html?lang=en).


## Resolution {#resolution}


The personalization block missed the "`href=`" keyword from the image link. Please see below:

Before:

`<draw:image xlink:"https://www.xxxxx.net/xx-xxxxx/uploads/2022/05/XXXXX-logo-648.jpg" />`

After:

`<draw:image xlink:href="https://www.xxxxx.net/xx-xxxxx/uploads/2022/05/XXXXX-logo-648.jpg" />`

Also, when creating the *docx* or *odt* template, do not write the code directly in the template file, but instead use a text editor (like notepad) to create the code and copy back the code in the template file. It will ensure accurate quotes and double quotes are used.
