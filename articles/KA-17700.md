# PDF generation with personalization blocks fails

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign Classic v7
- Campaign v8



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
When attempting to create a dynamic PDF attachment that includes personalization blocks, the workflow and delivery fail.

Documentation reference: [https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/personalizing-deliveries/generating-personalized-pdf-documents.html?lang=en](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/campaign-classic/using/sending-messages/personalizing-deliveries/generating-personalized-pdf-documents.html?lang=en)


## Resolution {#resolution}


The personalization block missed the "`href=`" keyword from the image link. Please see below:

Before:
`draw:image xlink:"https://www.xxxxx.net/xx-xxxxx/uploads/2022/05/XXXXX-logo-648.jpg" /`

After:
`draw:image xlink:href="https://www.xxxxx.net/xx-xxxxx/uploads/2022/05/XXXXX-logo-648.jpg" /`

Also, when creating the *docx* or *odt* template, do not write the code directly in the template file but instead use a text editor (like notepad) to create the code and copy back the code in the template file. It will ensure accurate quotes and double quotes are used.
