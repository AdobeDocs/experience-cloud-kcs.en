# [Report Builder] Limit on the number of days

## Description


What is the limit on the number of days in a single Report Builder request with daily granularity?


## Resolution


It's 371 days. It was designed with a hard limit of 366 days (considering the number of days in a leap year) but it failed to accommodate 5-4-4 calendars on leap years (53 weeks = 371 days). So it was re-calibrated to allow up to 371 days when required. It won't permit beyond 371 days.
