# Stuck in an infinite loop for redirect activity


Redirect 50% of the traffic from a page to the same page with a parameter added in Adobe Target. Learn how to do it in this article.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Target

### Issue/Symptoms

How to redirect 50% of the traffic from a page to the same page with a parameter added.
 Results give an infinite redirect loop instead.


## Resolution {#resolution}


### Cause

The issue of the infinite redirect loop is happening because <b>Experience B URL(redirecting Exp)</b> again qualifies the visitors for the activity. Hence the visitor is entering into the loop of qualifying for the activity multiple times.

### Solution

In order to resolve this you need to exclude (through template testing) <b>Experience B URL</b> to qualify for the activity.
