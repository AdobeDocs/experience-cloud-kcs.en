# Stuck in an Infinite Loop for Redirect Activity

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Target

<b>Issue</b>
 How to redirect 50% of the traffic from a page to the same page with a parameter added.
 Results give an infinite redirect loop instead.




## Resolution


<b>Cause</b>
The issue of the infinite redirect loop is happening because <b>Experience B URL(redirecting Exp)</b> again qualifies the visitors for the activity. Hence the visitor is entering into the loop of qualifying for the activity multiple times.

<b>Solution</b>
In order to resolve this you need to exclude (through template testing) <b>Experience B URL</b> to qualify for the activity.
