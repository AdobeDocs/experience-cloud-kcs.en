# Adobe Campaign Classic v7: non-admin operator cannot access Hot clicks report


Learn how to access Hot clicks report as a non-admin operator.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Classic v7

### Issue/Symptoms

If you are a non-admin operator, the Hot clicks report does not display at the delivery dashboard level. When you click on the report the report is empty. 

 Steps to reproduce:

1. Open a delivery.
2. Go to the <b>Reports </b>tab and click on <b>Hot clicks</b>. A blank page displays.



## Resolution {#resolution}


Contact an admin operator to request that they add you to the <b>Access to reports</b> operator group and add the <b>Access to reports</b> operator group to the Resources / Campaign management folder. Access to this folder is necessary for the Hot clicks calculations to work.

Note: The admin operator can add you to the <b>Access to reports</b> operator group with Read rights only, if that is their preference.
