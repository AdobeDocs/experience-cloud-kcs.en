This issue might occur if Commerce Cloud Config is not set on the page properties under advanced tab. Usually set this commerce cloud config on the site root page or landing page level in the content tree.

In order to fix this issue, kindly make sure to configure commerce cloud config in  "Cloud Configuration" field under the Advanced tab in page properties as shown in the screenshot below.
