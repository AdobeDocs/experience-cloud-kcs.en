# Data sync issues due to warehouse timeout in OOTB


To resolve data sync issues caused by the *warehouse timeout* error in theÂ OOTB `ffdaReplicateStagingData` workflow, contact Support to adjust the warehouse size to *temporarily increased* and re-run the workflow.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Classic v8

### Issue/Symptoms

`OOTB ffdaReplicateStagingData` workflow is not syncing data due to the following error:

`nlmoduleStagingSchema ODB-240000 Error ODBC: Statement reached its statement or warehouse timeout of 14,400 second(s) and was canceled.`




## Resolution {#resolution}


Create a ticket with Customer Care and adjust the warehouse size to <b>temporarily increased</b> and re-run the workflow.

Engage with an Adobe consultant to check your utilization and introduce option `NmsCleanup_FfdaStagingDataPurgeDelay` to decrease the amount of data stored in the table (set up by default to 7 days).

### Cause

The warehouse size is not enough to process the queries done by `ffdaReplicateStagingData` workflow.
