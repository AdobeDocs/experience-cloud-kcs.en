# Adobe Campaign Classic: "Connection refused" when connecting with mid-sourcing server


Proxy setting needs to be added with the IP in order to resolve the issue.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Classic (ACC)

### Issue

"Connection refused" error when connecting with mid-sourcing server.

Example error:


```
Communication error with server: please make sure it is configured correctly.Â  HTTP code 500 'XSV-350014 The '217.148.73.152' IP address via which you are accessing the server is not accepted. Connection refused.'
```



## Resolution {#resolution}


### Cause:

As part of security implementation, some jobs have been set up recently. One of which is Cron job which removed stale IP's.

Cron job identifies those IP's which don't have proxy settings. Unfortunately, this IP didn't have this setting and that's why this issue occurred.

### Resolution:

Proxy setting needs to be added with the IP in order to resolve the issue.
