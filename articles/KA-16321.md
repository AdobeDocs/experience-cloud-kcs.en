# Campaign Classic - Start and monitor workflow by command line


This article explains if it is possible to use a Linux command line to start and monitor workflows in Campaign Classic.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Campaign Classic
- Using Linux command line instead of GUI


### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

How to use a Linux command line to start and monitor workflows?


## Resolution {#resolution}


In general, you cannot control workflows by the command line.

There are a limited number of workflows that can run a command line (like cleanup or tracking), so those workflows could be run directly by a command line but:

- They are no longer part of a workflow so you lose the logs in the workflow UI.
- They are no longer monitored by the workflow engine (nlserver wfserver) so they are not automatically restarted if they crash.


We donâ€™t provide any tools to monitor those command lines since they are handled by the workflow engine by design.
