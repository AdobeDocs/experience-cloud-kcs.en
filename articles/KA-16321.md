# Campaign Classic - start and monitor workflow by command line

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign Classic
- Using Linux command line instead of GUI

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
- Want to use Linux command line to start and monitor workflows



## Resolution {#resolution}


In general, you cannot control workflows by the command line.

There are a limited number of workflows run a command line (like cleanup or tracking), so those workflows could be run directly by a command line but:

- They are no longer part of a workflow so you lose the logs in the workflow UI.
- They are no longer monitored by the workflow engine (nlserver wfserver) so they are not automatically restarted if they crash.


We donâ€™t provide any tools to monitor those command lines since they are handled by the workflow engine by design.
