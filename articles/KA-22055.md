# How to run post-upgrade for on-premises instances when there are multiple servers

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Campaign Classic




### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

If there are multiple servers both having *web@default*running, should the command be run on just one of the servers or both?


## Resolution {#resolution}


- If you happen to have multiple `<instance>.conf` files in the same box, and each one has a distinct connection to different databases (usually seen in environments with complex failover config), then you will have to upgrade the structure of two databases.
- If you have multiple `<instance>.conf` files pointing to the same database in the same box, then there is no point in running `allinstances param`. When all servers are connected to the same database, running the post-upgrade on the primary server is sufficient, and using the `allinstances param` will do just fine.

    


<b>Note</b>: If you want more control on what's being upgraded, it is better to explicitly define the instance to upgrade.
