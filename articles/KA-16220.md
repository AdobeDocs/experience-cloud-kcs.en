## Resolution


Solution:

1. Always try to log out when going on break or at end of the day and then start again with an incognito window to avoid such issues.

2. Try clearing browser cache regularly.

3. Install the latest version of Chrome as it could be due to some corruption at the browser level.

After following these points, the issue should not persist again.
