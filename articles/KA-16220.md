### Issue/Symptoms

You see the following error when trying to add an email delivery to a workflow:


```
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<html><head>
<title>400 Bad Request</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Bad Request</h1>
<p>Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand.</p>
</body></html>
```



## Resolution {#resolution}


After following these points, the issue should not persist again.

1. Always try to log out when going on break or at end of the day and then start again with an incognito window to avoid such issues.
2. Try clearing browser cache regularly.
3. Install the latest version of Chrome as it could be due to some corruption at the browser level.
