# Sending deliveries with different Sender Names

## Description

<b>Sender Names in deliveries</b><br><br> <br><br><b>Using different Sender Names in deliveries</b>


Sender Name in the delivery form helps determine the name with which you want your email to be viewed as and this is configured in email header parameters which you can view by clicking "From" in the email section in the specific delivery.



To change the Sender Name, you simply have to edit the name in the form above and no further action is required.

However, it is always better to perform certain steps to ensure decent IP/domain reputation of your deliveries.






## Resolution

<b>How to check the authenticity of a Sender Name</b><br><br> <br><br>
When introducing a new sender name, it is always suggested to to perform a placement test as it may have an impact at any point of time in future, hence it is always suggested to perform an inbox placement test using the sender name to validate it's authenticity.

You can perform an inbox placement test using the new sender names and then use them to target the delivery.

To perform the test, have 2-3 existing Gmail address and 2-3 new Gmail addresses. Send an Email with the new Sender name to all those Email addresses and check where exactly that Email landed to. Based upon the Emails landed to Junk / Spam or primary / promotion will help you know more about the sender name's impact.

The reason why we are suggesting Gmail is because majority of Email database s on Gmail only, hence testing on Gmail will help you. Rest testing can be done based on which ISP is the higher one, i.e. gmail, yahoo, hotmail etc.
