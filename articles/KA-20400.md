# Device co-op sunset

## Description

As of August 31st, 2022, the device co-op will be officially deprecated. This article outlines customer impacts & required steps. 

## Resolution


Deprecation work for the device co-op will begin August 31st, 2022. While the option to select the co-op may not be initially removed from the UI, the co-op device graph itself will be removed, therefore any segment populations utilizing the co-op may experience a noticeable decrease in size. We advise all customers to update their profile merge rules (PMRs) before August 31st, 2022.

To update PMRs, navigate to Audience Data  Profile Merge Rules, and select the rule in question. On the bottom right of the PMR overview page, you'll be able to update your device options selection:

Select 'Profile Link Device Graph' to continue targeting cross-device profiles, or 'Device Profile' to limit qualification to the current device. More details on the differences between these two options available here: [https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/features/profile-merge-rules/merge-rule-definitions.html?lang=en#device-options](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/features/profile-merge-rules/merge-rule-definitions.html?lang=en#device-options)

If you encounter issues or conflicts attempting to update your PMR, it's most likely due to the attached segments & the associated data export controls. In this case, we advise creating a net-new PMR (reach out to customer care to provision a new rule if you are at the limit): [https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/features/profile-merge-rules/merge-rules-start.html?lang=en#profile-merge-rule-setup](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/features/profile-merge-rules/merge-rules-start.html?lang=en#profile-merge-rule-setup)

Then, the BAAAM tool can be utilized to update all relevant segments from the old co-op PMR to your newly created rule: [https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/reference/bulk-management-tools/bulk-management-intro.html?lang=en#actions-ops](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/audience-manager/user-guide/reference/bulk-management-tools/bulk-management-intro.html?lang=en#actions-ops)

If you would like to have the co-op option removed from your UI, please adjust your PMRs as outlined above and then open a customer care ticket requesting to have the device co-op removed. Also, please feel free to open a ticket with any general questions or concerns surrounding this article or the general deprecation of the device co-op.
