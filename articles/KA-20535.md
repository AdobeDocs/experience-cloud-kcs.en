# Adobe Target: Visitors will not qualify for a segment created in AAM until the Target session expires and they come back


Learn how to qualify for a segment created in Adobe Audience Manager in the Target session.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

- Adobe Target
- Adobe Audience Manager


### Issue/Symptoms

Visitors, who qualify for a segment created in Adobe Audience Manager in the current session, will not qualify for it in Adobe Target until the Target session expires and they come back.


## Resolution {#resolution}


This behavior depends on a setting of the integration between Adobe Target and Adobe Audience Manager in the backend.  In this case, it is configured that Target will check Adobe Audience Manager segments once per session instead of in real time.  It is managed by Adobe, and the user cannot change it in the UI.
