# Brand logo file format configuration

## Description

<br>Environment<br><br>
Campaign Standard
<br><br>Issue/Symptoms<br><br>
Users may ask what type of file format is supported for a brand logo?


## Resolution


The brands have their logo files, and the default logo file is in a *PNG*file format. The supported logo file formats are .jpeg, .jpg, .gif, .png, and .tif.  Moreover, the user must have the *Deliverability Product Profile* for making any changes in brand identity and other branding executions.
