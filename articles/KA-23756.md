# CDN template in Application Setup doesn't save


CDN template in Application Setup can't be saved. Any changes disappear when logging out and logging in again.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Dynamic Media Classic

### Issue/Symptoms

The CDN template in Application Setup, which is used to invalidate images, disappears after logging in and out. It means that the invalidate CDN option is not working as the field is empty, and copying and pasting the template is required each time it disappears. It is causing a delay in invalidating the images on the website.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The Database field where the CDN template is saved has an upper limit of 2500 characters. When a CDN template larger than that is attempted to be saved, it results in an error in the logs, even though the UI does not indicate anything wrong. Bringing the template below 2500 characters will save it.



Here is what the logs indicate as a response to Company Settings update request with too big of a CDN template:
