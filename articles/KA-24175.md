# Circular dependency on schema extension error


This article describes how to resolve the Adobe Campaign Classic error: *circular dependency on schema extension nms:recipient*. Remove the attribute `extendedSchema="nms:recipient" `from the schema.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Classic

### Issues/Symptoms

When trying to create a new schema from UI (Administration /Configuration/ Data schemas), the following error appears:

"*circular dependency on schema extension nms:recipient (it can be any schema)*"


## Resolution {#resolution}


### Cause

The circular dependency issue appears due to the `nms:recipient` schema referring to itself due to the attribute `extendedSchema="nms:recipient"`. A schema extension should be extending some other schema and not trying to extend itself. Also, it's not recommended to modify any ootb schemas.

### Solution

To fix the circular dependency error, the attribute `extendedSchema="nms:recipient"` needs to be removed from the schema.
