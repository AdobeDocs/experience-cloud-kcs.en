# AEM log out issue even after SAML SSO authentication


Please make sure that the logout link on the AEM page is pointing to `/system/sling/logout.html?login=<secured path>,` and ensure that it's not an AJAX call.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)

<b>Issue</b>

When the Adobe Experience Manager is authenticated using the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) Single Sign-On (SSO), the user still can't log out even though the link is `/system/sling/logout.html.`


## Resolution {#resolution}


Please make sure that the logout link on the AEM page is pointing to `/system/sling/logout.html?login=<secured path>,` and ensure that it's not an AJAX call.

The right authentication handler is invoked by putting the parameter `login=<saml secured content>`, and the customer will be redirected to the right login page.
