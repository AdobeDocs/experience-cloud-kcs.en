# AEM log out issue even after SAML SSO authentication

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
Experience Manager

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

When the Adobe Experience Manager is authenticated using the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) Single Sign-On (SSO), the user still cannot log out even though the link is - */system/sling/logout.html.*


## Resolution {#resolution}


Please make sure that the log out link on the AEM page is pointing to - */system/sling/logout.html?login=`<` secured path`>`*. And ensure that, it's not an AJAX call.

The right authentication handler is invoked by putting the parameter `login=`<` saml secured content`>``, and the customer will be redirected to the right login page.
