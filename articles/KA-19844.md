# AEM Cloud Screens Content Provider has limited channel templates

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
Experience Manager as a Cloud Service


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
While creating a channel in Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service Screens Content Provider, there are only three templates:

1. Sequence Channel
2. Left L-bar Split Screen Channel
3. Right L-bar Split Screen Channel




Adobe Experience Manager 6.5 (on-prem) Screens Content Provider, on other hand has:

1. Application Channel
2. 1x1 Split Screen Channel
3. 2x2 Split Screen Channel


Can we have these channels on AEM Cloud as well?


## Resolution {#resolution}


The channel templates from Screens as a Cloud Service were mostly removed because they rarely applied as-is and required customers to usually change the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) to make them work for their use case.
The L-Bar templates we have, should already provide the same capabilities but were built so that they are easier to modify.

You can essentially follow this documentation 1 and just add the desired templates to your repository.
