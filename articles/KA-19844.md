# AEM Cloud Service [!DNL Screens] Content Provider has limited Channel templates compared to AEM on-prem

## Description

While creating a channel in AEM [!DNL Screens] Content Provider, there are only three templates:
1. Sequence Channel
2. Left L-bar Split Screen Channel
3. Right L-bar Split Screen Channel


AEM 6.5 on-prem on other hand has:
1. Application Channel
2. 1x1 Split Screen Channel
3. 2x2 Split Screen Channel


What does it take to have these channels as well on AEM Cloud Service?

## Resolution


The channel templates from [!DNL Screens] as a Cloud Service were mostly removed because they rarely applied as-is and required customers to usually change the CSS to make them work for their use case.
 The L-Bar templates we have should already provide the same capabilities but were built so they are easier to modify.
 You can essentially follow this documentation 1 and just add the desired templates to your repository.
