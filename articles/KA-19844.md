# AEM (cloud) Screens Content Provider has limited Channel templates compared to AEM on-prem

## Description

While creating a channel in AEM Screens Content Provider, there are only three templates:<br>1. Sequence Channel<br>2. Left L-bar Split Screen Channel<br>3. Right L-bar Split Screen Channel<br><br>AEM 6.5 on-prem on other hand has:<br>1. Application Channel<br>2. 1x1 Split Screen Channel<br>3. 2x2 Split Screen Channel<br><br>What does it take to have these channels as well on AEM Cloud?

## Resolution


The channel templates from Screens as a Cloud Service were mostly removed because they rarely applied as-is and required customers to usually change the CSS to make them work for their use case.
 The L-Bar templates we have should already provide the same capabilities but were built so they are easier to modify.
 You can essentially follow this documentation 1 and just add the desired templates to your repository.
