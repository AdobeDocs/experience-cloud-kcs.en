# AEM Cloud Screens Content Provider has limited channel templates

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Experience Manager as a Cloud Service

### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

While creating a channel in Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service Screens Content Provider, there are only three templates:

1. Sequence Channel
2. Left L-bar Split Screen Channel
3. Right L-bar Split Screen Channel




On the other hand, Adobe Experience Manager 6.5 (on-prem) Screens Content Provider has:

1. Application Channel
2. 1x1 Split Screen Channel
3. 2x2 Split Screen Channel


Can we have these channels on AEM Cloud as well?


## Resolution {#resolution}


The channel templates from Screens as a Cloud Service were mostly removed because they are rarely applied as-is and required you to change the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) to make them work for your use case.

The L-Bar templates should already provide the same capabilities, and were built such that they are easier to modify.

You can follow [this documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-screens/user-guide/developing/creating-custom-templates-multizone-layouts) and just add the desired templates to your repository.
