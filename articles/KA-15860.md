# Basic information about SAINT file header


Column C3 in the Saint classifications template is a numeric identifier for report suite and classification variable relationships that impact the FTP upload/classification process. This ID must be considered during the upload process, as it is crucial for accurate data categorization within Customer Journey Analytics.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Customer Journey Analytics
- Analytics


### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

What does column C3 represent in the file header for the Saint classifications template? Does it have an impact on the FTP saint upload process?


## Resolution {#resolution}


The first is a numeric identifier (not to be used for any other purpose) of the report suite. The second part is the relation ID of the classification variable (conversion/traffic variable).

Since these numbers are related to the report suite and classification being used, they do impact the FTP upload/classification process.
