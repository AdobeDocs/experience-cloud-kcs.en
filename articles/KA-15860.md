# Basic information about SAINT file header

## Description


What does column C3 represent in file header for Saint classifications template? Does it have an impact on the FTP saint upload process?


## Resolution


The first is a numeric identifier(not to be used for any other purpose) of the report suite. The second part is the relation ID of the classification variable(conversion/traffic variable).

Since these numbers are related to the report suite and classification being used, they do impact FTP upload/classification process.
