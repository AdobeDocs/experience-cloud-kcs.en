# Unable to set the ECID cookie after implementing first party tracking server(s)


In Adobe Analytics, if the `s_ecid` cookie is not set in the browser when upgrading to the Experience Cloud ID (ECID) service using a first-party tracking server, ensure that the tracking server domain matches the site domain.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Analytics



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

`s_ecid` cookie is not set in the browser when upgrading to the ECID service and using a first-party tracking server. Why?


## Resolution {#resolution}


- Ensure the VisitorAPI.js is updated to the latest version ([https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/id-service/releases](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/id-service/releases)) and the first-party tracking server is implemented. The tracking server domain should match the site domain.
- ECID cookie is generated server-side using the request header information passed in the web beacon. In case the request header is getting changed, then the value of the tracking server would change and s_ecid wouldn't be generated on a different domain.


<b>Cause</b>

If visitor migration is enabled then the web beacon may be getting routed from 1st party tracking server to 3rd party tracking server, which would be causing the issue with s_ecid generation.
