The tools listed below are utilities which help us in validating AEM environments and troubleshooting issues.<br><br>
1. [Bundle Version Checker](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-cloud-kcs/kbarticles/KA-17501.html?lang=en) - Compare the versions of Open Service Gateway Initiative (OSGi) bundles installed across AEM versions or across environments.
2. [OSGi Component Diff](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kb/tools/osgi-component-diff.html) - Compare the OSGi components across AEM environments.
3. [Content Package Compare](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kb/tools/content-package-comparator.html) - Compare content packages installed across AEM environments.
4. [Activity Log Analyzer](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kb/tools/activity-log-analyzer.html) - Validate the node additions and deletions that are done during the package installations.
5. [Node Diff](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kb/tools/aem-node-diff.html) - Check nodes across environments using Content Repository Extreme Development Environment (CRX/DE) query service.
6. [Package Validator](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-4/sites/administering/using/package-manager.html#ValidatingPackages) - Validate OSGi, Access Control Lists (ACL) and Overlays during package installation.
