1. [Bundle Version Checker](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-cloud-kcs/kbarticles/KA-17501.html?lang=en) - Compare the versions of Open Service Gateway Initiative (OSGi) bundles installed across AEM versions or across environments.
2. [OSGi Component Diff](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kb/tools/osgi-component-diff.html) - Compare the OSGi components across AEM environments.
