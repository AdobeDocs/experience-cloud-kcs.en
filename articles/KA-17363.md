# Adobe Campaign Standard: Can deleted deliveries be recovered in ACS?

## Description


It has been asked whether or not ACS has the ability to recover deleted deliveries.


## Resolution


Currently there is no way to recover a deleted delivery in ACS. An enhancement in CAMP-49870 has been created to have this addressed in a future release.
