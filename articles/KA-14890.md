# SMS delivery failure: Error - Text Too Long


SMS delivery can frequently fail because of the *Text too long/SMS too long* error, even though the SMS Template specifies the number of SMSs per message. This article offers a solution to tackle this issue.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Standard



### Issue/Symptoms

SMS deliveries often fail due to *Text Too Long/SMS Too Long* error, even though the number of SMSs per message is defined in the SMS Template.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The *Maximum number of SMS per message* option allows you to define the number of SMS to send a message. If this number exceeds the limit, the message will not be sent.Â In such cases, it is always suggested to check the number of characters in the content within the SMS.

Number of characters in SMS can be counted here: [https://www.burstsms.com/sms-character-counter/](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.burstsms.com%2Fsms-character-counter%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cnmenon%40adobe.com%7C80deda92112a4286ebe808d730ece95c%7Cfa7b1b5a7b34438794aed2c178decee1%7C0%7C0%7C637031666453005966&amp;sdata=8f3baxxeo5SN%2B4WkWAM4Ba4LQIwxP%2FbtuZJTDb7VGtk%3D&amp;reserved=0)



<b>*Note:</b> Even a difference of single character in the text can cause the number of SMSs to exceed the limit.*
