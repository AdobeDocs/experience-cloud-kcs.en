# SMS delivery failure: Error - Text Too Long

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Campaign Standard

### Issue/Symptoms

We often find our SMS deliveries failing due to *Text Too Long/SMS Too Long* error even though the number of SMS per message is defined in the SMS Template.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The <b>Maximum number of SMS per message</b> option allows you to define the number of SMSs to send a message. If this number exceeds the limit, the message will not be sent. In such cases, it is always suggested to check the number of characters in the content within the SMS.

Number of characters in SMS can be counted here: [https://www.burstsms.com/sms-character-counter/](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.burstsms.com%2Fsms-character-counter%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cnmenon%40adobe.com%7C80deda92112a4286ebe808d730ece95c%7Cfa7b1b5a7b34438794aed2c178decee1%7C0%7C0%7C637031666453005966&amp;sdata=8f3baxxeo5SN%2B4WkWAM4Ba4LQIwxP%2FbtuZJTDb7VGtk%3D&amp;reserved=0)

<b>*Note:</b> Even a difference of single character in the text can cause the number of SMS message to exceed the limit.*
