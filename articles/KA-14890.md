# SMS delivery failure: Error - Text Too Long

## Description

Environment<br>

<br>Issue/Symptoms<br>
Text Too Long error in SMS deliveries

We often find our SMS deliveries failing due to *Text Too Long/SMS Too Long* error even though the number of SMS per message is defined in the SMS Template.

The <b>Maximum number of SMS per message</b><b> </b>option allows you to define the number of SMSs to send a message. If this number exceeds the limit, the message will not be sent.Â In such cases, it is always suggested to check the number of characters in the content within the SMS.


## Resolution

Number of characters in SMS can be counted here: [https://www.burstsms.com/sms-character-counter/](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.burstsms.com%2Fsms-character-counter%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cnmenon%40adobe.com%7C80deda92112a4286ebe808d730ece95c%7Cfa7b1b5a7b34438794aed2c178decee1%7C0%7C0%7C637031666453005966&amp;sdata=8f3baxxeo5SN%2B4WkWAM4Ba4LQIwxP%2FbtuZJTDb7VGtk%3D&amp;reserved=0)


*Note: Even a difference of single character in the text can cause the number of SMS message to exceed the limit.*
