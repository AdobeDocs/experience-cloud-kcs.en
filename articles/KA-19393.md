## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Campaign Classic
- Campaign
- Campaign Classic v7
- Campaign v8

<b>Issues/Symptoms</b><br>While creating Measurement Hypotheses in Campaign Classic, the error given below

*NMS-470007 No link defined between 'nms:trackingLogRcp' and reaction log tables ('nms:remaMatchRcp').*

## Resolution {#resolution}


There is no Out-of-the-Box links already defined between *'nms:trackingLogRcp'*and*'nms:remaMatchRcp'*

The link given below is present in nms:trackingLogRcp

*`<` element belongsTo="gam:remaMatchRcp" label="Reactions of recipients" name="remaMatchRcp-trackingLog" pkgStatus="never" revLink="trackingLog" target="nms:remaMatchRcp" type="link" unbound="true"`>`*

However in nms:remaMatchRcp, there is a composite key.

*`<` element belongsTo="gam:remaMatchRcp" label="Reactions of recipients" name="remaMatchRcp-trackingLog" pkgStatus="never" revLink="trackingLog" target="nms:remaMatchRcp" type="link" unbound="true"`>`*

To resolve this, extend the nms:remaMatchRcp and add the link to the nms:trackingLogRcp



<b><u>Cause:</u></b>  Links not defined.
