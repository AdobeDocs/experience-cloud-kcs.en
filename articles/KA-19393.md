# [ACC] Error while creating Measurement Hypotheses


An error occurs while creating Measurement Hypotheses in Adobe Campaign Classic. It happens because there are no predefined links between the `nms:trackingLogRcp` and `nms:remaMatchRcp`.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

- Adobe Campaign Classic
- Adobe Campaign
- Adobe Campaign Classic v7
- Adobe Campaign v8


### Issues/Symptoms

The following error occurs while creating Measurement Hypotheses in Campaign Classic:

*NMS-47xxxx No link defined between 'nms:trackingLogRcp' and reaction log tables ('nms:remaMatchRcp').*


## Resolution {#resolution}


There are no out-of-the-box links already defined between `nms:trackingLogRcp` and `nms:remaMatchRcp`.

The link given below is present in `nms:trackingLogRcp`.

*`<` element belongsTo="gam:remaMatchRcp" label="Reactions of recipients" name="remaMatchRcp-trackingLog" pkgStatus="never" revLink="trackingLog" target="nms:remaMatchRcp" type="link" unbound="true"`>`*

However, in `nms:remaMatchRcp`, there is a composite key.

*`<` element belongsTo="gam:remaMatchRcp" label="Reactions of recipients" name="remaMatchRcp-trackingLog" pkgStatus="never" revLink="trackingLog" target="nms:remaMatchRcp" type="link" unbound="true"`>`*

To resolve this, extend the `nms:remaMatchRcp` and add the link to the `nms:trackingLogRcp`.
<br>Cause<br>
Links not defined.
