# Campaign Classic V7: Number of login attempts in ACC


This article talks about the number of login attempts that can be made by a user in Campaign Classic and which builds support this functionality.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Campaign Classic

### <b>Issue</b>

How can you limit the number of login attempts in Campaign Classic in build 9032?

New options are described in [Adobe Campaign: API Documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/developer/campaign-api/api/sm-session-Logon.html).

However, these options (`XtkSecurity_max_Unsuccessul_Attempts_Allowed`, `XtkSecurity_Initial_Ban_Duration`, `XtkSecurity_Max_Ban_Duration`, `XtkSecurity_Examine_Window`) are not present in the build 9032.

What build of Adobe Campaign Classic has those options and functionality?


## Resolution {#resolution}


These options were added in Campaign Classic builds starting 9080.

You will not get this feature in the Gold Standard release 9032.
