# Campaign Classic V7 - Number of Login Attempts in ACC

## Description


How can we limit the number of login attempts by a user in Campaign Classic in build 9032?

New options are described in the documentation
[https://experienceleague.adobe.com/developer/campaign-api/api/sm-session-Logon.html](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/developer/campaign-api/api/sm-session-Logon.html)

 However, these options (XtkSecurity_max_Unsuccessul_Attempts_Allowed, XtkSecurity_Initial_Ban_Duration, XtkSecurity_Max_Ban_Duration, XtkSecurity_Examine_Window) are not present in the build 9032.

<b>Could you please clarify from what build of Adobe campaign classic those options and the functionality itself is available?</b>


## Resolution


These options were added in build 9080 onwards. You will not get this feature in the Gold Standard release 9032.
