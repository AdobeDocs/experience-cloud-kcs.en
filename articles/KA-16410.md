# Campaign Classic V7: Number of login attempts in ACC

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Campaign Classic
 Adobe Campaign

<b>Issue</b>
 How can you limit the number of login attempts by a user in Campaign Classic in build 9032?

New options are described in [Adobe Campaign: API Documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/developer/campaign-api/api/sm-session-Logon.html).

 However, these options (`XtkSecurity_max_Unsuccessul_Attempts_Allowed`, `XtkSecurity_Initial_Ban_Duration`, `XtkSecurity_Max_Ban_Duration`, `XtkSecurity_Examine_Window`) are not present in the build 9032.

What build of Adobe Campaign Classic has those options and functionality?


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>

These options were added in build 9080 onwards.

You will not get this feature in the Gold Standard release 9032.
