# "noData.erMissing algoId" appears in recommendations trace on the page

## Description


"noData.erMissing algoId"Â  error appears randomly on the first page load of activity URL. [!DNL Recommendations] work fine on refresh without any error.


## Resolution


It happens for entities not cached at the [!DNL Target] edge server. On refresh, R3 edge gets the result and delivers entity recommendations for the same page, which did not deliver on the first hit.

To avoid this, there is a privilege available in client settings of choosing consistency over speed.



<u>Steps for the above configuration:</u>

1. Log in to <b>[!DNL Recommendations classic] </b>and Click on <b>[!UICONTROL Edit]</b> against the required account.

2. Ensure "[!UICONTROL Redirect to central on first NoContentDataException]" is selected.

*<u>The above configuration ensures that if the R3 edge does not have the recommended entities, the results would be fetched from the central server. This may lead to a delay in fetching the results on the first page load. However, it would ensure consistent recommendation results on each page load.</u>*
