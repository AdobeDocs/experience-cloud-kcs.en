# "noData.erMissing algoId" shown in recommendations trace on the page

## Description


"noData.erMissing algoId"Â  error appears randomly on the first page load of activity URL. Recommendations work fine on refresh without any error.


## Resolution


It happens for the entities which are not cached at Target edge server. On refresh, r3edge gets the result and deliver entity recommendations for the same page which did not deliver on first hit.

To avoid this, there is a privilege available in client settings of choosing consistency over speed.



<u>Steps for above configuration :</u>

1. Login to Recommendations classic and Click on Edit against the required account

2. Ensure "Redirect to central on first NoContentDataException" is selected

*<u>The above configuration ensures that if R3 edge does not have the recommended entities, the results would be fetched from central server . This may add a delay in fetching the results on first page load, however would ensure that consistent recommendation results on each page load&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>*
