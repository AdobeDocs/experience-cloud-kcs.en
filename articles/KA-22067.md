# Campaign invalid password when testing iOS certificate

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
Campaign Classic v7 and v8 releases.
<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
When creating the iOS mobile app while trying to test the iOS certificate, the following errors are generated:

Cannot test the connection.\nError: Invalid password.. INT-150012 The HTTP query returned a '' type error (500) (iRc=-53)


## Resolution {#resolution}


To get more information on the issue, enable the debug mode by updating the external account associated with the iOS routing and append `?debug=true `to the iOS URL connection. For example:

`http://localhost:8080/nms/jsp/iosHTTP2.jsp?debug=true`

Then sanitize the certificate. Extract client certificate into apns_dev_cert.pem from the generated certificates and do not include keys:

`openssl pkcs12 -in client_certificate.p12 -out apns_dev_cert.pem -clcerts -nokeys`

 Where:
`-clcerts`: only output client certificates (not CA certificates)
`-nokeys`: no private keys will be output

 Extract the key into apns_dev_key.pem from the generated certificates without decrypting it and without certificates:

`openssl pkcs12 -in client_certificate.p12 -out apns_dev_key.pem -nocerts -nodes`

 Where:
`-nocerts:` no certificates at all will be output
`-nodes: `do not encrypt the private keys at all

 Regenerate a p12 certificate file from both key and certificate. The sanitization allows to only keep what is necessary to connect: 

`openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey apns_dev_key.pem -in apns_dev_cert.pem -out new_certificate.p12`

<b>Cause</b>

The following error means that the certificate integrity is invalid and sanitizing steps are needed to fix the certificate integrity:
