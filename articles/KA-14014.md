# Proof emails are received with [domain name] in their subject line

## Description


While sending proofs to your internal users on your own email domain, some emails received have domain name in their subject line.


## Resolution


This is usually caused by the Outlook Exchange spam filter, managed by Microsoft. We suggest you check with your internal IT and Microsoft why this occurs.
