# Proof emails received with [domain name] in subject line

## Description


<b>Environment</b>

- Campaign
- Campaign Standard




<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

While sending proofs to your internal users on your own email domain, some emails received have domain name in their subject line.


## Resolution


This is usually caused by the Outlook Exchange spam filter, managed by Microsoft. We suggest you check with your internal IT and Microsoft to know why this occurs.
