# Unable to see any value from "Long text" fields in email

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Campaign Standard



### <b>Issues / Symptoms</b>

When trying to create text fields with the type "Long text" in any Custom Resource (say table extended from Profile).

 After publishing, the field is filled with text and when trying to display text from this field in an email, one can see nothing but this variable `<%= context.profile.cusTestMemoField %>.`

 Clicking on the "<b>data</b>" link on the sidebar shows the text in JSON, but it is impossible to print the value from this field anywhere in the email.


## Resolution {#resolution}


The issue is in the `srcSchemas` generated when publishing a `cusResource` using a Long Text field.
 
The field is generated as:
 
`<attribute category="99_none" label="longText" name="cusLongText" type="memo"/>`
 
And is referenced in the resource definition as:
 
`<attribute name="cusLongText" template="ext:recipient:recipient/@cusLongText"/>`
 
Now, the above is coherent but equally wrong.
 
<b>Correct syntax:</b>


```
<element category="99_none" label="longText" name="cusLongText" type="memo"/>
```


 
And referenced as:


```
<element name="cusLongText" template="ext:recipient:recipient/cusLongText"/>
```
