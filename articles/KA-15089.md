# Campaign Standard - Unable to see any value from "Long text" fields in email

## Description


I am trying to create text fields with the type "Long text in any Custom Resource (say table extended from Profile).

 After publishing, I fill this field with some text and then try to display the text from this field in the email, but I see nothing when I receive an email with this variable %= <b>context.profile.cusTestMemoField</b> %.

 When I click on “Data” link on the left sidebar, we are able to see the text in <b>JSON</b>, but it is impossible to print the value from this field anywhere in email.


## Resolution


<b>*Details of the Issue:</b>*
  
 The issue is in the srcSchemas generated when publishing a cusResource using a Long Text field.
  
 The field is generated as:
  
 attribute category="99_none" label="longText" name="cusLongText" type="memo"/
  
 And is referenced in the resource definition as:
  
 attribute name="cusLongText" template="ext:recipient:recipient/@cusLongText"/
  
 Now, the above is coherent but equally wrong.
  
<b>Correct syntax:</b>
  
 element category="99_none" label="longText" name="cusLongText" type="memo"/
  
 And referenced as:
  
 element name="cusLongText" template="ext:recipient:recipient/cusLongText"/
