# Analytics Report Builder Reports Sending Scientific Notation in PDF

## Description


Why and what to do when an ARB scheduled report is showing numbers in scientific notation in a PDF.


## Resolution


This is due to a difference in settings between Excel on a user's computer and on the Report Builder scheduling server.

Workaround: Use the Text() function in the scheduled ARB report to turn the value into its textual representation.
