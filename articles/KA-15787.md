# Analytics Report Builder Reports Sending Scientific Notation in PDF

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Analytics

<b>Issue</b>
 Why and what to do when an ARB scheduled report is showing numbers in scientific notation in a PDF.

<b>Cause</b>
 This is caused by a difference in settings betweenÂ Excel on a user's computer and on the Report Builder scheduling server.


## Resolution


<b>Workaround</b>
Use the `Text()` function in the scheduled ARB report to turn the value into its textual representation.
