# Purchase event with Purchase ID does not show in reporting

## Description

Issue/Symptoms
<br>A purchase event with a purchase ID does not show in reporting


## Resolution


Resolution
The image request is considered a duplicate purchase if the purchase ID matches any value already collected in the report suite across all visitors. Â All conversion variables, including the purchase event, do not appear in reporting.

Currently, purchase IDs (duplicate purchases) do not follow the data retention periods and exist forever.
