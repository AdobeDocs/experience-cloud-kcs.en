# gpg: cannot open '/dev/tty': No such device or address error while encrypting/decrypting using PGP keys

## Description


You get the following error `while trying to use the encrypt post-process command or the decrypt pre-process command.`


```
gpg: cannot open '/dev/tty': No such device or address
```





## Resolution


This error happens because the system tries to output to /dev/tty which either does not exists in the file system, or the neolane user does not has rights of this directory. In order to fix it, we need to by-pass this step. In the GPG command, add --no-tty to skip this step. For eg:



etl

preProcessCommand command="gpg --decrypt <b>--no-tty</b> --recipient \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* &quot;$fileName&quot;" label="Decryption GPG" name="GPGdecrypt"/
      postProcessCommand command="gpg --encrypt <b>--no-tty</b> --recipient \*\*\*\*\*\*\* &quot;$fileName&quot;" label="Encryption GPG" name="GPGencrypt" suffix="gpg"/

/etl

Also plesae check if  --passphrase passphrase in preProcessCommand is present or not . If passphrase is missing then also we can get this error


```
etl
        preProcessCommand name="GPGdecrypt" label ="Decryption GPG" command="gpg --decrypt --passphrase passphrase --recipient CampaignOperations@adobe.com &quot;$fileName&quot;"/
        postProcessCommand name="GPGencrypt" label ="Encryption GPG" command="gpg --encrypt --recipient comp_ops@xxx.com.au &quot;$fileName&quot;" suffix="gpg"/
    /etl
```
