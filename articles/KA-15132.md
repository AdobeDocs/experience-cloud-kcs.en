# Error - gpg: cannot open '/dev/tty': No such device or address - when encrypting/decrypting using PGP keys


To fix the error `"gpg: cannot open '/dev/tty': No such device or address"` while encrypting or decrypting using PGP keys, bypass the step where the system tries to output to `/dev/tty` by adding `--no-tty`  in the GPG command.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

- Campaign Classic
- Campaign
- Campaign Standard




### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Getting the following error when using the encrypt post-process command or the decrypt pre-process command.


```
gpg: cannot open '/dev/tty': No such device or address
```





## Resolution {#resolution}


To fix the error mentioned above, you need to bypass the step where the system tries to output to `/dev/tty`, which either does not exists in the file system or the neolane user does not have rights to this directory. In the GPG command, add `--no-tty` to skip this step. E.g.:


```
<etl>
    <preProcessCommand command="gpg --decrypt --no-tty --recipient <b></b><b></b> &quot;$fileName&quot;" label="Decryption GPG" name="GPGdecrypt"/>
    <postProcessCommand command="gpg --encrypt --no-tty --recipient <b></b><b>* &quot;$fileName&quot;" label="Encryption GPG" name="GPGencrypt" suffix="gpg"/>
</etl>
```

</b>Cause<b>
This error happens because the system tries to output to `/dev/tty`, which either does not exists in the file system, or the neolane user does not have rights to this directory.

Also, check if the passphrase inÂ `preProcessCommand` is present or not. If the passphrase is missing, then also we can get this error.


```
<etl>
        <preProcessCommand name="GPGdecrypt" label ="Decryption GPG" command="gpg --decrypt --passphrase passphrase --recipient CampaignOperations@adobe.com &quot;$fileName&quot;"/>
        <postProcessCommand name="GPGencrypt" label ="Encryption GPG" command="gpg --encrypt --recipient comp_ops@xxx.com.au &quot;$fileName&quot;" suffix="gpg"/>
    </etl>
```
