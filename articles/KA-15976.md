# Campaign Classic: [!UICONTROL Message Center] Service level and [!UICONTROL Processing time] reports are blank

## Description


It has been reported that post upgrade the message center reports below are displaying with no data:

1. Message Center service level
2. Message Center processing time


## Resolution


<b>Cause: </b>

This error usually happens when the OOB workflow "updateEventsStatus" is not running.

<b>Resolution:</b>

Restart the workflow (updateEventsStatus) to resume the workflow activity at the back end.

The following should be seen in the audit logs:


```
16/06/2020 14:30:06 end AuditTrail: Option 'MC_LastRtEventStat' with id '6199' modified by 'admin'.
16/06/2020 14:30:06 end AuditTrail: Option 'MC_LastRtEventStat' with id '6199' modified by 'admin'.
16/06/2020 14:30:06 writer6 0/0 record(s) processed (step 'Update queue size')
16/06/2020 14:30:06 writer6 : Insertion of 0 record(s) 'Update queue size' step)
```


This workflow is responsible for fetching data in the reports.

Once restarted, the reports should display correct data as expected.
