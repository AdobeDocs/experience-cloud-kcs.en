# Campaign Classic: Message Center Service Level and Processing Time reports are blank


The Message Center Service Level and Message Center Processing Time reports show no data after the upgrade. Restart the workflow `updateEventsStatus` to resolve the issue.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Classic



### Issue/Symptoms

Post upgrade the message center reports below are displaying with no data:

1. Message Center Service Level
2. Message Center Processing Time



## Resolution {#resolution}


Restart the workflow `updateEventsStatus` to resume the workflow activity at the back end.

The following should be seen in the audit logs:


```
16/06/2020 14:30:06 end AuditTrail: Option 'MC_LastRtEventStat' with id '6199' modified by 'admin'.
16/06/2020 14:30:06 end AuditTrail: Option 'MC_LastRtEventStat' with id '6199' modified by 'admin'.
16/06/2020 14:30:06 writer6 [ 0/0]  record(s) processed (step 'Update queue size')
16/06/2020 14:30:06 writer6 : Insertion of 0 record(s) 'Update queue size' step)
```


This workflow is responsible for fetching data in the reports.

Once restarted, the reports should display correct data as expected.

### Cause

This error usually happens when the OOB workflow `updateEventsStatus` is not running.
