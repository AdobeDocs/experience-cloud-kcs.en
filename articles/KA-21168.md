# What is my Audience Manager (and/or ID Service) Container ID and where can I find it?

## Description {#description}


When a container ID other than the default (0) is needed for an AAM (and/or ID Service) implementation, how does one know what container ID to use? Is it the container ID in the AAM UI or some other value?


## Resolution {#resolution}


When an AAM implementation needs to use a different container ID instead of the standard/default container (0), then the value to put into ID service and the Audience Management Module for Analytics (or in the DIL configuration code) is the container number based on when the container was created, NOT the container ID in the AAM UI. To get the proper value, take the following steps

1. Log into Audience Manager and click Tools  Tags
2. When the Tags page loads, click on the container in question
3. In the right rail, locate the Container Code box
4. Locate the akamai.net or cdn.demdex.net request. The number in the path just after the tenant ID is the numeric value to use in the code. Do NOT use the container ID. In the example/screenshot below, the value to use is 1.

Note: The code in the Container Code box is NOT code that you should place on any web properties. It's here only for the sake of getting the Container value needed for the idSyncContainerID configuration of ID Service, the Container NSID value of the Audience Management Module of Analytics, or the containerNSID value of a DIL implementation when anything other than the default ID sync container is needed.
