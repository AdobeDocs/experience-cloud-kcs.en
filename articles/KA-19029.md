# Adobe Audience Manager: How to share segments with Adobe Campaign via Adobe Campaign – Declared ID destination

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
 Audience Manager segment mapped to Adobe Campaign Declared ID destination

<b>Issue</b>
 Unable to import segment from Audience Manager to Campaign


## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Steps to Resolve</b>
 For sharing an Audience Manager segment with Adobe Campaign, you need to set up a Profile Merge profile using the*Adobe Campaign - Declared ID*data source.

Step 1: Create an Onboarded type Trait using Adobe Campaign – Declared ID data source.
 AAM only outputs the data that the data source of Trait is the same as the destination's outbound user ID.
 Step 2: Create a Profile Merge Rule using the following option.

- Cross-Device Options: Last Authenticated Profiles
- Cross-Device Profile Options: Adobe Campaign – Declared ID
- Device Options: Device Profile


Step 3: Create a segment using the Profile Merge Rule created in Step 2.
 Step 4: Map the segment to *Adobe Campaign - Declared ID*destination.
