# How to share Adobe Audience Manager segments with Adobe Campaign via Adobe Campaign – Declared ID destination

## Description

I have requested the integration between Adobe Audience Manager and Adobe Campaign, and I mapped an Audience Manager segment to *Adobe Campaign - Declared ID* Destination. However, the segment can't be imported from Adobe Campaign. How can I share an Audience Manager segment with Adobe Campaign?
<br> 

## Resolution


For sharing an Audience Manager segment with Adobe Campaign, you need to set up a Profile Merge profile using the*Adobe Campaign - Declared ID*data source.

Step1: Create an Onboarded type Trait using Adobe Campaign – Declared ID data source.
 AAM only outputs the data that the data source of Trait is the same as the destination's outbound user ID.
  
 Step2: Create a Profile Merge Rule using the following option.

- Cross-Device Options: Last Authenticated Profiles
- Cross-Device Profile Options: Adobe Campaign – Declared ID
- Device Options: Device Profile


Step3: Create a segment using the Profile Merge Rule created in Step2.
  
 Step4: Map the segment to *Adobe Campaign - Declared ID*destination.

Please refer to the following document if you have any questions related to how to request AAM-AC integration and how to import segments on the Adobe Campaign side
