# Adobe Audience Manager: How to share segments with Adobe Campaign via Adobe Campaign – Declared ID destination

## Description {#description}

<br>Issue:<br><br>
Unable to import segment from Audience Manager to Campaign
<br><br> <br><br>Environment<br><br>
Audience Manager segment mapped to Adobe Campaign Declared ID destination

<br> <br>

## Resolution {#resolution}

Steps to Resolve<br>
For sharing an Audience Manager segment with Adobe Campaign, you need to set up a Profile Merge profile using the*Adobe Campaign - Declared ID*data source.

Step1: Create an Onboarded type Trait using Adobe Campaign – Declared ID data source.
AAM only outputs the data that the data source of Trait is the same as the destination's outbound user ID.
 
Step2: Create a Profile Merge Rule using the following option.

- Cross-Device Options: Last Authenticated Profiles
- Cross-Device Profile Options: Adobe Campaign – Declared ID
- Device Options: Device Profile


Step3: Create a segment using the Profile Merge Rule created in Step2.
 
Step4: Map the segment to *Adobe Campaign - Declared ID*destination.

Please refer to the following document if you have any questions related to how to request AAM-AC integration and how to import segments on the Adobe Campaign side
