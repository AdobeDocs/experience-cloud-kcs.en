# Category affinity across more than one attribute

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
Target


<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
Can the category affinity algorithm be utilized across more than one attribute?

Currently, I have category affinity configured to retrieve the page category name (e.g., scarves, t-shirts, bedsheets, coats). However, I’d like to know if there is a way that I can be a bit more granular with my categories. In addition to my page category, I’d also like the algorithm to consider the product material (e.g., linen, silk, cotton) as well. In other words, how can I utilize category affinity across both page category and product material? Is it possible to establish multiple instances of algorithms to score different attributes?


## Resolution


For granularity, you can add a second dimension to the category like `scarves:silk`, `scarves:cotton`, `t-shirts:cotton`, `t-shirt:linen`, etc.

Now, when the user navigates your site, the category affinity array could look like this:

`scarves:cotton`, `t-shirts:cotton`, `t-shirts:linen`, `t-shirts:silk`, `bedsheets:cotton`

With this, you can see the visitor has an affinity for t-shirts and also an affinity for cotton products.
