# "AH01620: Could not open password file" in logs after configuring Basic Auth in AEM dispatcher


Rename the `.htpasswd` file to remove the initial "." period mark (For example: change "`.htpasswd`" to "`_htpasswd`").

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) as a Cloud Service with Basic Auth configured
 Added a `.htpasswd` file in the `/conf.d` folder.

<b>Issue</b>
`Error "AH01620: Could not open password file: /etc/httpd/conf.d/.htpasswd`" in logs after configuring <b>Basic Auth</b>.


```
[ authn_file:error]  [ pid 241:tid 140454739073848]  (2)No such file or directory: [ client 000.00.00.000:0]  AH01620: Could not open password file: /etc/httpd/conf.d/.htpasswd
```





## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Steps to Resolve</b>
Rename the `.htpasswd` file to remove the initial "." period mark (For example: change "`.htpasswd`" to "`_htpasswd`").

<b>Cause</b>
The files starting with a "." period mark are considered hidden and removed while preprocessing the configuration.
