# "AH01620: Could not open password file" messages in the logs after configuring Basic Auth in the AEM dispatcher

## Description {#description}

<br>Issue<br><br>
- Error "AH01620: Could not open password file: /etc/httpd/conf.d/.htpasswd" in logs after configuring Basic Auth



```
authn_file:error pid 241:tid 140454739073848 (2)No such file or directory: client 000.00.00.000:0 AH01620: Could not open password file: /etc/httpd/conf.d/.htpasswd
```

Environment
- Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service with Basic Auth configured
- Added a .htpasswd file in the /conf.d folder.





## Resolution {#resolution}

Steps to Resolve
- Rename the .htpasswd file to remove the initial '.' i.e., change ".htpasswd" to "_htpasswd"

<br>CauseÂ <br>
The files starting with a "." are considered hidden and removed while preprocessing the configuration.
