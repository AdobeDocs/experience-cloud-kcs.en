# The Non-Apple SSO TV Provider Authentication Flow

## Description

<b>Objective</b>
How to handle the authentication flow when a non-Apple SSO supported Pay-TV provider (MVPD) is selected from the MVPD Picker?


<b>Environment</b>
iOS/ tvOS


## Resolution

<b>Steps</b>
After the user selects an unsupported TV Provider, programmer's app receives the following callbacks:

- <b>dismissTvProviderDialog</b> - At this point, programmer should hide Apple's *viewController* (it contains the picker).
- <b>sendTrackingData</b> - This is just an MVPD selection event.
- <b>status</b> - This contains a dictionary that looks like:

    | `2018-02-23 13:29:14.228410+0200 APIExplorer-tvos252:11681 {`<br><br>`    errorId = REGCODE;`<br><br>`    expires = 1519387154016;`<br><br>`    level = success;`<br><br>`    message = 6ANC6PH; //SAMPLE_7_DIGIT_CODE}` |
    | --- |


- At this point, programmer should present the user with the message contained in this dictionary. In this case, it can be similar to: *Please go to network-site/activate and enter the following code: 6ANC6PH*.
- During this time, the SDK polls Adobe servers for the status of the above mentioned registration code. Once the user uses that registration code to authenticate, the SDK gets a 200 status code from Adobe servers and the next callback is fired.


- <b>setAuthenticationStatus</b> - If the status is 1, the authentication was successful.


- <b>sendTrackingData </b>- This is just an authentication detection event.

The tvOS app crashes if the setRequestor is not handled correctly, as for tvOS programmer also provides the public key and the secret. See [Clientless documentation](http://tve.helpdocsonline.com/clientless-integration-cookbook-v2$create_dev) for details.
