How to handle the authentication flow when a non-Apple Single Sign-On (SSO) supported Pay-TV provider (Multichannel Video Programming Distributor - MVPD) is selected from the MVPD Picker?


## Resolution {#resolution}

<b>Steps</b>
After the user selects an unsupported TV Provider, programmer's app receives the following callbacks:

- <b>dismissTvProviderDialog</b> - At this point, programmer should hide Apple's *viewController* (it contains the picker).
- <b>sendTrackingData</b> - This is just an MVPD selection event.
- <b>status</b> - This contains a dictionary that looks like:

    | `2018-02-23 13:29:14.228410+0200 APIExplorer-tvos[ 252:11681]  {`<br><br>`    errorId = REGCODE;`<br><br>`    expires = 1519387154016;`<br><br>`    level = success;`<br><br>`    message = 6ANC6PH; //SAMPLE_7_DIGIT_CODE}` |
    | --- |


- At this point, the programmer should present the user with the message contained in this dictionary. In this case, it can be similar to: *Please go to `<` network-site`>` /activate and enter the following code: 6ANC6PH*.
- During this time, the Software Development Kit (SDK) polls Adobe servers for the status of the above-mentioned registration code. Once the user uses that registration code to authenticate, the SDK gets a 200 status code from Adobe servers and the next callback is fired.


- <b>setAuthenticationStatus</b> - If the status is 1, the authentication was successful.


- <b>sendTrackingData </b>- This is just an authentication detection event.
