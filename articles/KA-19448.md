## Description

I don't know what permissions to access the Adobe Developer Console (Adobe I/O) ( https://developer.adobe.com ). What privileges do I need to access it?

Access is granted by granting "Developer" or "System Administrator" privileges on the [!DNL Admin Console] ( https://adminconsole.adobe.com ) to the user who needs access.
