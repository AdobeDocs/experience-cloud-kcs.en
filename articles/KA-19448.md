# Access privileges for the Adobe Developer Console (Adobe I/O)

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Admin

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

What are the permissions required to access the Adobe Developer Console (Adobe I/O) (https://developer.adobe.com)?


## Resolution {#resolution}


Access is enabled by granting "Developer" or "System Administrator" privileges on the Admin Console (https://adminconsole.adobe.com) to the user who needs access.

How to [log in to the Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/getting-started/)?

- First, [create an Adobe account](https://developer.adobe.com/console) or sign in using your existing account.
- If you want to log in with a company or school account, [contact an administrator](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/kb/contact-administrator.html) in your organization to request developer role permissions.
- If you are logging in with a personal account, you are automatically provided a personal developer organization.
- You can also switch between organizations if you have been granted "Developer" or "System Administrator" privileges for multiple organizations. You can do so by using the organization switcher (<b>org switcher</b>). Click on the <b>org switcher</b> dropdown and select the desired organization.


If you can't access the Developer Console, check with your administrator for these [permissions on your Adobe ID](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/debugging/debugging-aem-as-a-cloud-service/developer-console.html?lang=en#developer-console-access):

- The Adobe Org related to the product that you want to work on should be active in the Adobe Org switcher.
- You should be added to product profiles of products that include API access on the Admin Console.
- You must be a member of the appropriate Adobe IMS Product Profile.
- Developer Console also requires your user record to be created in the corresponding product's service tier for it to authenticate to that service tier.
