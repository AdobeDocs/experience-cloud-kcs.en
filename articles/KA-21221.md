# Unable to Save Look-a-like Model

## Description {#description}

When using a look-a-like model in AAM and it refuses to save.

## Resolution {#resolution}


If the model in question uses data from Marketplace, be sure that the data you are using in the model is enabled for modeling. If it is not, then the look-a-like model will not save. If this isn't the problem, open a support case.
