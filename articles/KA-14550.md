# Can [!UICONTROL Profile Scripts] be used to build up audiences based on click event?

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Target

<b>Issue</b>
 How to use [!UICONTROL Profile Scripts] to track click events on the page and be able to build audiences based on the collected data.


## Resolution


<b>Solution steps</b>
Keep in mind that [!UICONTROL Profile Scripts] run on [!DNL Target] server-side, this means they have no visibility of client-side events (events that happen in the user browser) unless the browser makes a call to [!DNL Target] passing the relevant data.

1. So if you want to run a profile script on a click event you have to add a `getOffer()` or `trackEvent()` function to listen to the onclick event.
2. In the `trackEvent()` you can pass any necessary data as parameters within the request.
3. Then in the profile script you should add logic that only runs the script when the specific request being tracked (onclick event) is executed.
4. Take any of the applicable data and read/store/parse it as needed.


As an example, by using this code on a webpage:

`a href="#" onclick="adobe.target.trackEvent({mbox:'dataCapture', params:{'param1':'value1'}});"click here/a`

The example profile script can look for an mbox named `dataCapture` (or any other mbox name you have defined), then it could read my <b>param1</b> value for further utilization, e.g.:


```
if (mbox.name == 'dataCapture') {
    var x = mbox.param('param1'); 
    return x; 
}
```

The profile script value (`param1`) can then be used to create an audience rule.

Please note the code above is only a sample, make sure your code logic surfaces the requirements of your use case.
