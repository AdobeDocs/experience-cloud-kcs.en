# AJO | now() timestamp adding extra digits to the milliseconds


Learn how to resolve the issue with importing files when the now() timestamp adds extra digits to the milliseconds.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Journey Optimizer (AJO)

### Issue/Symptoms

Fields that contain now() timestamps are adding extra digits to the milliseconds. It is causing issues when importing data using the date/time filter.

Previous Version (used to be up to 6 digits)
2023-05-16T02:11:44.642584-04:00
Changed around May 19th or after (more than 6 digits)
2023-06-08T20:58:34.483010503-04:00


## Resolution {#resolution}


The issue can be resolved by adding the extra digits in milliseconds in your system when importing the data.

### Cause

The migration to Java 17 on May 17th led to timestamp differences, causing import failures when downloading files with date/time filter down to the millisecond.
