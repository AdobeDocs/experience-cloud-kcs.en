# Campaign Classic: Quarantines don't sync from MKT to RT/MID instances

## Description


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Campaign Classic
 Adobe Campaign

<b>Issue</b>
 Addresses present in Quarantines are not synched properly from a marketing instance to RT and MID instances.


## Resolution


<b>Solution</b>
The reason for this is Quarantines do not sync from marketing to RT or MID instances, but only from RT and MID to the marketing instance.
