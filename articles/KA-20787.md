# AEM Desktop App shows a blank page after connecting


Trying to log in to the AEM Desktop app returns an error message: *An error occurred while logging in. Please check the logs for more details*. It is because the proxy is trying to block access to the AEM author. After bypassing the proxy, the error should be resolved.

## Resolution {#resolution}


The errors in the logs indicate a connection error. Using a proxy blocked access to the AEM author via the AEM desktop app. You have to bypass the proxy to be able to successfully connect.
