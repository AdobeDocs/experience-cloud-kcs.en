# Filter on Inbox Notifications Page results in error


The issue is  caused by the acs-aem-commons-content-4.8.0.zip 3rd-party app package.

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)

<b>Issue</b>
When trying to use the filter for the inbox notifications, the following server error is received in the browsers dev console:


```
<html><head><title>500 Internal Server Error</title></head><body><h1>Internal Server Error</h1><p>Cannot serve request to /mnt/overlay/xxxxxxx/ui/content/shell/omnisearch/searchresults.html in /libs/granite/ui/components/xxx/foundation/table/table.jsp</p><h3>Exception:</h3><pre>java.lang.NullPointerExceptionat org.apache.sling.resourcereso
```

<br> <br>The issue is reproducible on AEM 6.5.13<br>Steps to reproduce the issue:<br>1. Go to Inbox -`>`  View All.<br>2. Click on <b>Filter</b>. 
3. The error *Failed to submit form* is displayed.

## Resolution {#resolution}


On an out-of-the-box AEM 6.5.13 instance filtering on inbox notifications works as expected.

The issue is  introduced by the acs-aem-commons-content-4.8.0.zip package. Once this package is installed on the instance filtering on inbox notifications no longer works.

However, ACS isn't a package supported by Adobe.

This is a 3rd-party app provided by Adobe Consulting Services (it's Adobe, but still outside the engineering team) and any issue should be reported here:
