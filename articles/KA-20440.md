## Description {#description}

When trying to use the filter for the inbox notifications, the following server error is received in the browsers dev console:<br><br>

```

<br><br> <br><br>The issue is reproducible on AEM 6.5.13<br><br>Steps to reproduce the issue:<br><br>1.  Go to Inbox -`>`  View All<br><br>2. Click on Filter. 
<br>3. The error "Failed to submit form" is displayed

## Resolution {#resolution}


On an out-of-the-box AEM 6.5.13 instance filtering on inbox notifications works as expected.

It was found that the issue is  introduced by the acs-aem-commons-content-4.8.0.zip package. Once this package is installed on the instance filtering on inbox notifications no longer works.

However, ACS is not a package supported by AdobeThis is a 3rd party provided by Consulting (yet Adobe, but still outside the engineering team) and any issue should be reported here:
