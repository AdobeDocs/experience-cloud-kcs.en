# Unable to export recipientID in ACS


You won't be able to extract these columns as they are defined with the attribute <b>`pkgStatus`</b> set to <b>*never</b>*. This means you'll never be able to export it.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environments</b>

- Adobe Campaign
- Adobe Campaign Standard


### <b>Issue</b>

You won't be able to export `recipientID` from the profile table in ACS.


## Resolution {#resolution}


You won't be able to extract these columns as they are defined with the attribute <b>`pkgStatus`</b> set to <b>*never</b>*. This means you'll never be able to export it.

The `recipientID` is encrypted and is passed across various entities in Adobe Campaign Standard for referencing data, such as reports, workflows, deliveries, etc. Now the ID is just a numeric number and is assigned in series. Hence it's very easy to predict random recipient IDs and pull data from Campaign which is, in turn, a security flaw.

In ACC (Adobe Campaign Classic) the internal `cryptString` function is used to first encrypt the `recipientID`, and then use in URLs as query parameters. Hence you can export it as it will be of no use until you use the internal `cryptString` function to do any kind of querying in web-apps or JSSPs.
