# Performance Issues while editing content


To troubleshoot performance issues when editing content, in the browser developer console, verify which is the most time-consuming request and check the request URL. Then, upgrade to a version equivalent to or newer than AEM SDK version 2023.9.13665.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

AEM as a Cloud Service

Version: AEM SDK v2023.8.13206 or older

### Issue/Symptom(s)

You may face performance issues when editing pages if you have an AEM SDK version older than version 2023.9.13665.

For example, on a new and empty experience fragment, adding a single text component sometimes takes up to 15 seconds until the page is usable again. The page stops responding, waits for something, and at some point refreshes.


## Resolution {#resolution}


### Troubleshooting

In the browser developer console, verify which is the most time-consuming request and check the request URL.

For the example above:

![](assets/76c14aea-ad8a-ee11-8179-6045bd006a22.png)

Search in the author's error log for the path in the request URL - e.g. `/content/experience-fragments/path/to/experience/fragment/_jcr_content/root/container/text`

### Resolution

Upon checking the logs, it can be seen that the reason for the delay is <b>`[` 1`]` </b>. The `ProcessorUtils` waits for the job to be in the index which can take some time depending on the repositories state. On average the minimum wait time is 5 to 7 seconds and then the time it takes for the job to run.

This is a known issue tracked under the internal Jiras - SITES-14804 and GRANITE-45493. Nevertheless, a fix has been implemented and it was included in Oak version 1.54 - <b>`[` 2`]` </b>.

Oak 1.54 was included in AEM SDK version 2023.9.13665.

Therefore, the environment where this issue is encountered needs to be upgraded to a version equivalent to or newer than 2023.9.13665 in order to mitigate this behavior.
