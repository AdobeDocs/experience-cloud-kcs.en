# Performance Issues while editing content


Environment: AEM as a Cloud Service

Version: AEM SDK v2023.8.13206 or older

## Description {#description}

Customers with an AEM SDK version older than version 2023.9.13665 may face performance issues when editing pages.<br><br>
<br>For example, on a new and empty experience fragment, adding a single text component sometimes takes up to 15 seconds until the page is usable again.
<br>The page stops responding, waits for something, and at some point refreshes.

## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Troubleshooting:</b>

In the browser developer console, verify which is the most time-consuming request and check the request URL.

For the example above:

![](assets/76c14aea-ad8a-ee11-8179-6045bd006a22.png)

Search in the author's error log for the path in the request URL - e.g. /content/experience-fragments/path/to/experience/fragment/_jcr_content/root/container/text

<b>Resolution:</b>

Upon checking the logs it can be seen that the culprit for the delay is `[` 1`]` . The ProcessorUtils waits for the job to be in the index which can take some time depending on the repositories state. On average the minimum wait time is 5 to 7 seconds and then the time it takes for the job to run.

This is a known issue tracked under the internal Jiras - SITES-14804 and GRANITE-45493. Nevertheless, a fix has been implemented and it was included in Oak version 1.54 - `[` 2`]` .

Oak 1.54 was included in AEM sdk version 2023.9.13665.

Therefore, the environment where this issue is encountered needs to be upgraded to a version equivalent to or newer than 2023.9.13665 in order to mitigate this behavior.
