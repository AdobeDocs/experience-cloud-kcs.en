<br>Causes<br>
- Alert preview is just an approximation count, which varies as the training data varies.
- The preview is an approximation. The count can change as the lookback calculation changes.
- Alerts are ephemeral. Â An anomaly today may not be an anomaly when the data is re-evaluated a week from today based on math.
- The forecasted boundaries and expected values change based on the time used as the basis of the evaluation.
