# Number of triggered alerts in Alert Preview may differ from the actual number

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Intelligent Alerts



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

The number of triggered alerts shown in the Alert Preview in the Intelligent Alerts UI may differ from the actual number of alerts triggered.






## Resolution {#resolution}


Reach out to Customer Care in case you see unexpected results in the preview in the Alerts UI.
<br>Causes<br>
- Alert preview is just an approximation count, which varies as the training data varies.
- The preview is an approximation. The count can change as the lookback calculation changes.
- Alerts are ephemeral. Â An anomaly today may not be an anomaly when the data is re-evaluated a week from today based on math.
- The forecasted boundaries and expected values change based on the time used as the basis of the evaluation.
