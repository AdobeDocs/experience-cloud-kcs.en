# Multiple versions of dynamic content appear in the mobile content editor


This article addresses the issue in Adobe Campaign Standard where content set for both desktop and mobile appears in the mobile editor when creating dynamic content within a delivery. A possible workaround is to set display to show on all devices.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Standard

### Issue/Symptoms

When creating dynamic content within a delivery and when switching to the mobile editor, content that was set to display only for the desktop, as well as content set to display for the mobile, will both appear.

If the content is set to display on either version, only one version of the content will display. This does not happen within the desktop content editor. When the content is proofed or sent to a recipient, it displays correctly without the duplicate content.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Currently, there is no fix for the issue. `CAMP-50710` has been opened with R&D to address this in a future release.

The workaround for this is to set the display options on the content to <b>show on all devices</b>Â whenever possible.
