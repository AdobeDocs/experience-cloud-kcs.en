# Multiple versions of dynamic content appear in the mobile content editor

## Description {#description}


It has been reported that when creating dynamic content within a delivery that when switching to the mobile editor, content that was set to display only for the desktop, as well as content set to display for the mobile, will both appear. If the content is set to display on either version, only one version of the content will display. This does not happen within the desktop content editor. When the content is proofed or sent to a recipient, it displays correctly without the duplicate content.


## Resolution {#resolution}


Currently, there is no fix for the issue. `CAMP-50710` has been opened with R&D to address this in a future release.



The workaround for this is to set the display options on the content to "show on all devices" whenever possible to mitigate the problem.
