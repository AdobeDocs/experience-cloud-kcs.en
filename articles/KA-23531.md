# Workflows are set to "not Editable" after code deployment


After creating a Workflow in AEM and there is a code deployment, the Workflow appears as "Not Editable".

Experience Manager as a Cloud Service



### Issue/Symptoms

After creating a Workflow in AEM and there is a code deployment, the Workflow appears as "Not Editable".


## Resolution {#resolution}

Resolution<br>
### When you create a workflow, its model is saved by default in 
`/conf/global/settings/workflow/models`
###  

### and when you perform the sync operation to make it usable, the model is also saved in 
`/var/workflow/models`
### 
The best practice says that you should keep your workflow models in the codebase to be consistent across multiple environments, and you don't have to re-create Workflows per each environment.

### 
When creating a workflow using the AEM UI, the outcome is that after a code deployment, the 
<br>/conf/global/settings/workflow/models <br>
### is overwritten as per the codebase filter configuration
<br>`<` filter root="/conf/global/settings/workflow/models" mode="replace" /`>` <br>
###  

### and this creates an issue because the model in 
<br>/conf/global/settings/workflow/models<br>
###  

### is deleted since it's not in the codebase and the model in 
<br>/var/workflow/models <br>
### is not deleted but is still usable instead.

### 
<b>Since you no longer have the model in </b>
<b>/conf/global/settings/workflow/models</b>
### <b>the workflow model is marked as "Not Editable".</b>
