# Workflows are set to "not Editable" after code deployment


This article resolves the AEM issue where after creating a Workflow in AEM followed by a code deployment, the Workflow appears as "*Not Editable*". As best practice, you should keep your workflow models in the codebase consistent across multiple environments, so you don't have to re-create Workflows per each environment.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Experience Manager as a Cloud Service

### Issue/Symptoms

After creating a Workflow in AEM and there is a code deployment, the Workflow appears as "*Not Editable*".


## Resolution {#resolution}


When you create a workflow, its model is saved by default in:


```
/conf/global/settings/workflow/models
```


and when you perform the sync operation to make it usable, the model is also saved in:


```
/var/workflow/models
```


The best practice says that you should keep your workflow models in the codebase to be consistent across multiple environments, and you don't have to re-create Workflows per each environment.

When creating a workflow using the AEM UI, the outcome is that after a code deployment, the


```
/conf/global/settings/workflow/models
```


is overwritten as per the codebase filter configuration.


```
<filter root="/conf/global/settings/workflow/models" mode="replace" />
```


This creates an issue because the model in:


```
/conf/global/settings/workflow/models
```


is deleted since it's not in the codebase, and the model in:


```
/var/workflow/models
```


is not deleted but is still usable instead.

<b>Since you no longer have the model in:</b>


```
/conf/global/settings/workflow/models
```


<b>the workflow model is marked as "Not Editable".</b>
