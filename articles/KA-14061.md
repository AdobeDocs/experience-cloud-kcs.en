# Adobe Target mboxPCID not writen when [!UICONTROL Cross-Domain] is enabled.

## Description


In this scenario, a company is trying to implement Adobe Target for their two domains using DTM. They have enabled cross domain tracking – setting both 1st and 3rd party cookies in the Adobe Target UI.

When traveling from one domain to another, they see the mbox call firing, however, the MboxPcId is not written.


## Resolution


In the most common scenarios check for the third party cookies on the website. Cross domain means mboxPC will be saved on 'tt.omtrdc.net' domain.

You should be able to see the mboxPC set in the third party cookies.
