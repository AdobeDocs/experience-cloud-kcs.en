# Adobe Target mboxPCID not writen when Cross-Domain is enabled.

## Description


Customer is trying to implement Adobe Target for their two domains using DTM. They have enabled cross domain tracking – set both 1st and 3rd party cookies in the Adobe Target UI.

When they travel from one domain to another, we can see the mbox firing, however, the Mbox Pcid is not being written.


## Resolution


In the most common scenarios check for the third party cookies on the website. Cross domain means mboxPC will be saved on 'tt.omtrdc.net' domain.

You should be able to see the mboxPC set in the third party cookies.
