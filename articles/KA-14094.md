# Is a Target profile attribute overwritten with each visit?

## Description {#description}


Is the target profile attribute value overwritten each time?


## Resolution {#resolution}


No, the profile attributes are not overwritten by default. Unless you explicitly change the value, it remains the same until the profile expires.

You can verify this by looking at the profile attribute value in the mbox trace to observe the before and after values. For more information, refer toÂ [Debug at.js using the Adobe Experience Cloud Debugger](https://developer.adobe.com/target/implement/client-side/target-debugging-atjs/target-debugging-atjs/).
