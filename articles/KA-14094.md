# Is a [!DNL Target] profile attribute overwritten with each visit?

## Description


Is the target profile attribute value overwritten each time?


## Resolution


No, the profile attributes are not overwritten by default. Unless you explicitly change the value, it remains the same until the profile expires.

You can verify this by looking at the profile attribute value in the mbox trace to observe the before and after values.
