# Does a Target profile attribute value is overwritten with each visit?


Learn if Target profile attribute value is overwritten with each visit, and how to verify that the attributes have not changed.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Target

### Issue/Sypmtoms

Is the target profile attribute value overwritten each time?


## Resolution {#resolution}


No, the profile attributes are not overwritten by default. Unless the values are explicitly changed and it remains the same until the profile expires.

Verify this by looking at the profile attribute value in the mbox (marketing box) trace to observe the before and after values.
