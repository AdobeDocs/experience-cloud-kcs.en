# Is a Target profile attribute overwritten with each visit?


Learn if a Target profile attribute value is overwritten with each visit, and how to verify that the attributes have not changed.

## Description {#description}


Is the target profile attribute value overwritten each time?


## Resolution {#resolution}


No, the profile attributes are not overwritten by default. Unless you explicitly change the value, it remains the same until the profile expires.

You can verify this by looking at the profile attribute value in the mbox trace to observe the before and after values. For more information, refer toÂ [Debug at.js using the Adobe Experience Cloud Debugger](https://developer.adobe.com/target/implement/client-side/target-debugging-atjs/target-debugging-atjs/).
