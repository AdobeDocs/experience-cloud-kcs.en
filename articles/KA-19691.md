# AEP - Data feed mappings not available in source connector - Cannot proceed to next stage after selecting [!UICONTROL file]

## Description


In this example, you are connecting to an SFTP or S3 data source and despite selecting the file you want to import, the data feed mappings are not available in source connector.

In other words, you cannot proceed to next stage after selecting file.




## Resolution


You need to select the data format before anything happens.
Example: by selecting data format "Delimited - comma - gzip" in this particular instance, the file preview then builds up in the UI and you can proceed to the next steps, including the field mappings.
