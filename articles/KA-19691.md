# AEP - Data feed mappings not available in source connector

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Platform

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

In this case, despite connecting to a Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) or S3 data source and selecting the file to be imported, the data feed mappings are not available in source connector.

This does not allow the user to proceed to the next stage after selecting the file.




## Resolution {#resolution}


You need to select the data format before anything happens. For example:

By selecting data format "Delimited - comma - gzip" in this particular instance, the file preview builds up in the UI and you can proceed to the next steps, including the field mappings.
