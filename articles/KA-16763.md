# Create trait to capture all values in variable c_evar1

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
Audience Manager


<b>Issues/Symptoms</b>
How to create a trait to capture all incoming values in variable `c_evar1` in Adobe Audience Manager (AAM)?


## Resolution {#resolution}


This is achievable with the help of *Regular Expressions.*

A condition such as `(c_evar1 matchesregex "*.*$")`Â would make a trait to capture all the values coming into AAM. This will act as if `c_evar1` exists.
