# How to include path data in the response image using Dynamic Media


We upload images with path info / clipping path, and would like to have thet path data present in the response image.
 Can that be done?

## Resolution {#resolution}


In order to include the path info into the response image, but not apply it, you would use the parameter "pathembed" as documented here:
 https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/dynamic-media-developer-resources/image-serving-api/image-serving-api/http-protocol-reference/command-reference/r-pathembed.html?lang=en

So the URL would be like this:
 https://domain/is/image/company/image?pathEmbed=1

In order to apply the path in the response image, turning the area outside the path into transparency, you would use the parameter "clipPathE" as documented here:

[https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/dynamic-media-developer-resources/image-serving-api/image-serving-api/http-protocol-reference/command-reference/r-clippath.html?lang=en](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/dynamic-media-developer-resources/image-serving-api/image-serving-api/http-protocol-reference/command-reference/r-clippath.html?lang=en)

So the URL would be like this

https://domain/is/image/company/image?clipPathE=`<` path name`>`

In order to apply the path in the response image, turning the area within the path into transparency and display the area outside the path, you would use the parameter "clipXPathE" as documented here:

[https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/dynamic-media-developer-resources/image-serving-api/image-serving-api/http-protocol-reference/command-reference/r-clipxpath.html?lang=en](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/dynamic-media-developer-resources/image-serving-api/image-serving-api/http-protocol-reference/command-reference/r-clipxpath.html?lang=en)

So the URL would be like this

https://domain/is/image/company/image?clipXPathE=`<` path name`>`

Since the default output format is jpeg, which doesn't support transparency, using either of the above might give the impression that it doesn't work because the transparency is converted into the background color. You might want to use "fmt=png-alpha" instead to bleed the website background through the image.
