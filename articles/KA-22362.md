# How to change cookie validity


To increase or decrease the period of cookie validity in Adobe Campaign, change the value of the two new parameters: `permanentCookieValidityDuration` and `visitorCookieValidityDuration`.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

- Adobe Campaign v7
- Adobe Campaign v8


### Issue/Symptoms

The cookie validity is long, and it has to be reduced.

#### Steps to reproduce

1. Access a<b> URL</b> that points to the instance you are using. For example, *a tracking URL.*
2. Open your browser's developer console and go to the tab <b>Application</b>.
3. On the left panel displayed, select <b>Cookies</b> and check the expiration date of this site.



## Resolution {#resolution}


Starting with versions<b> ACC 7.3.2</b> and<b> 8.4.1</b>, two new parameters have been added to the `serverConf.xml` file, redirection section:

`permanentCookieValidityDuration` and `visitorCookieValidityDuration`.

By default, these are set up to 33696000 seconds (1 year). One can change the value of these two parameters to reduce or increase the validity period of the cookies.

<b>From the configuration, these parameters have the following definition:</b>

- `permanentCookieValidityDuration`: Duration of the `uuid230` and `nllastdelid` cookies validity in seconds, 0 means no cookies Default: 33696000
- `visitorCookieValidityDuration`: Duration of the `AMCV_ cookie` validity in seconds, 0 means no cookie Default: 33696000


### Cause

In the previous versions, the default cookie validity is of <b>13 years</b>. This is hardcoded under versions prior to <b>7.3.2</b> and <b>8.4.1</b>.
