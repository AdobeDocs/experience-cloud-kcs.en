# Workfront: Stuck export


If your Kick-start export or a Resource Planner export is stuck, you can identify the stuck export to delete so you can run your desired export.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Workfront



### Issue/Symptoms

After starting an export, such as a <b>Kick-start export</b> or a <b>Resource Planner export,</b> users do not see a file get exported and are unable to start a new one as the export option is grayed out or there is a message stating that there is still an ongoing export.



### Cause

This can sometimes occur with larger background jobs.


## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Solution Steps</b>



1. Identify if there is a background job that is still showing as <b>Running</b> by running the following API call:


    ```
    https://{yourdomain}.my.workfront.com/attask/api/v16.0/bkgjob/search?fields=status,handlerClassName
    ```




    The `handlerClassName` and `status` searches are included to help with narrowing down your results so you can easily find the one with a status of <b>Running</b> and the type of export you were attempting to run.

1. Once you have identified the stuck export, copy that ID (the <b>background job ID)</b> for use in <b>Step 5</b>.

1. Collect the <b>session ID</b> that is going assist with removing this stuck export by using the following API call:


    ```
    https://{yourdomain}.my.workfront.com/attask/api/session
    ```




1. Copy the ID you see for the <b>sessionID</b> line in the results for use in <b>Step 5</b>.

1. Once you have the <b>background job ID</b> and the <b>sessionID</b>, execute the following API call to remove the export, replacing `backgroundJobID` and `sessionID` with the IDs that you collected in the previous steps:


    ```
    https://{yourdomain}.my.workfront.com/attask/api/v16.0/bkgjob/{backgroundJobID}?method=delete&sessionID={sessionID}
    ```




1. If successful, you will see a <b>*True</b>* message confirming that it is deleted.

    If you refresh the page where you searched for background jobs (Step 1), you will see that the <b>Running</b> job should no longer be listed.

1. Return to the export you wanted to attempt, and the option should now be available.
