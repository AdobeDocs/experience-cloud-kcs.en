# Error in ACS and AEM integration

## Description

<br><br><br>Environment<br><br>
- Campaign
- Campaign Standard



<br><br>Issue/Symptoms<br><br>
Error *Could not find configuration for domain 'publish'<b>* </b>occurs<b> </b>when trying to sync templates from AEM to ACS.


## Resolution


The error *Could not find configuration for the domain 'publish'* is triggered from the AEM end when ACS calls the content sync functions. It probably happens because of syncing issues between the author and the publisher servers on the AEM end. Get the Externalizer settings in AEM corrected for the problem to be fixed.
