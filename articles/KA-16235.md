# SHA256 and SHA512 functions return wrong hash

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Campaign
- Campaign Classic

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
The customer reported that SHA256 and SHA512 functions return a wrong hash.

 Below link shows some other user also raised the same issue:
 https://experienceleaguecommunities.adobe.com/t5/adobe-campaign-classic-questions/sha256-and-sha512-function-returns-wrong-hash/qaq-p/351035/comment-id/3882


## Resolution


A customer has shared a solution:

The problem occurred because Adobe converts string datatype to `nvarchar` instead of `varchar` in the case when the DB is using Unicode encoding. In the customer's case, database encoding default is used as Unicode to support the *Thai* language. Therefore, Adobe converted the string to `nvarchar`.

For the functions <b>SHA256</b> and <b>SHA512</b>, it works as normal, but it will return different values of hash for `varchar` and `nvarchar`.

In the customer's case, it was possible to change that field (containing a mobile number only) to `varchar` and hash it correctly.

Additionally, if the SQL Server is used, the digest function uses the <b>UTF-16</b> representation of the string. You will not get the expected digest (which is often calculated on <b>ASCII</b> or <b>UTF-8</b> character).

<b>Example: *hello</b>* will give 14cde7c9ad35de5a37fce2ac276742175028fd9f7cdf0dae01ff508b126429d9 as <b>SHA-256</b> on the <b>ASCII/UTF-8</b> representation of the string and will give 18fe2820b38427a08a5b49fb4d71a7027799bfe0050d3050ca4d3491a85aa0eb on the <b>UTF-16</b> representation.
