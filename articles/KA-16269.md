# Campaign: How inbound SMS (InSMS) are linked to outbound SMS sent by Campaign

## Description


<b>Environment</b>:

Campaign sends an SMS text, and the recipient responds to the text

<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

How are the outbound and inbound text messages linked with one another?


## Resolution


<b>Resolution/Workaround</b>

Use the recipient's mobile phone number and the timestamps from the delivery logs to associate the sent text and the reply.

<b>Cause</b>

At this time, there is no single identifier that links an SMS text with the response, so we would need to infer the connection through the logs, looking at phone number and timestamp.
