# Production pipeline failure


This article addresses the common issue of production pipeline failures within Adobe Cloud Manager due to the presence of invalid solution KPIs.

## Description {#description}


Customers may encounter pipeline failures if Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are not properly configured or are missing for the solutions they have purchased. This issue is often identified by an error message stating "Invalid pipeline: `[` Pipeline ID`]` . Reason=Program has invalid solution KPIs."


## Resolution {#resolution}


To resolve this issue, follow these steps:
 1. Review the current KPI configurations within Service Now to ensure that they accurately reflect the solutions purchased and the expected performance metrics.
 2. If KPIs are missing or incorrect, update the configurations to match the required KPIs for the purchased solutions.
 3. Clear any running pipelines that may be affected by the previous KPI settings.
 4. Rerun the pipeline to validate that the updated KPIs are now correctly recognized and that the pipeline completes successfully.
