# DNS configuration issue for www record | AEMaaCS


When attempting to configure DNS, for example, as described in the AEM as a Cloud Service user guide under *Configuring DNS Settings*, you may encounter errors related to the www record. This article provides a solution to help you resolve the issue.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service (AEMaaCS)



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

When trying to configure a Domain Name System (DNS), for example, as described in [Configuring DNS Settings](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/using-cloud-manager/custom-domain-names/configure-dns-settings.html) in the AEM as a Cloud Service user guide, you get the errors with the www record.


```
The www record required an IP and the customer tried with the following combinations without success:

- www  - A - 600 - cdn.adobeaemcloud.com

- www - CNAME - 600 - cdn.adobeaemcloud.com

- www - A - 600 - example.com

- www - A - 600 - 151.101.195.10
```

<br><br>When using the `dig` command for the domain there are missing entries for the www record `[` 1`]` .<br><br>`dig example.com`



```
ANSWER SECTION:
example.com. 0 IN      A       151.101.131.10
example.com. 0 IN      A       151.101.3.10
example.com. 0 IN      A       151.101.67.10
example.com. 0 IN      A       151.101.195.10
```

`dig www.example.com`




```

```

Add a second domain in Cloud Manager for your website, ensuring that you include the SSL certificate uploaded in the Cloud Manager UI.
