# Adobe IO for Target - what is maximum number of requests per second?

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>

Target



<b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

An organization is using Adobe IO Target APIs to retrieve change logs and performance data of activities for their markets.

After many successful requests, their requests begin to fail with an HTTP 503 error of *Service Unavailable*. They succeed when they retry these failed requests after a few minutes. The customer is using [https://mc.adobe.io/${requestData.tenant}/target/activities/${requestData.type}/${requestData.activityId}/report/performance?reportInterval=${requestData.startDate}/${requestData.endDate}](https://mc.adobe.io/$%7brequestData.tenant%7d/target/activities/$%7brequestData.type%7d/$%7brequestData.activityId%7d/report/performance?reportInterval=$%7brequestData.startDate%7d/$%7brequestData.endDate%7d) to retrieve performance data. They found that the API seems to fail after 50 requests. If the customer waits for 30 sec to 1 min, then most of the next set of requests will be successful.

What is the maximum number of requests per second the customer should make?What is the maximum number of requests per second the customer should make?

## Resolution {#resolution}


The maximum number of requests per second that the customer can make is 50/min.

This is a general throttling per user.
