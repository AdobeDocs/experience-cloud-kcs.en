# Adobe IO for Target - what is maximum number of requests per second?


A short guide to understand what the maximum number of requests per second is for Adobe IO Target.

## Description {#description}


An organization is using Adobe IO Target APIs to retrieve change log and performance data of activities for their markets.

After many successful requests, Their requests begin to fail with a HTTP 503 error of *Service Unavailable*. If customer retry these failed requests after a few minutes, they succeed. The customer is using [https://mc.adobe.io/${requestData.tenant}/target/activities/${requestData.type}/${requestData.activityId}/report/performance?reportInterval=${requestData.startDate}/${requestData.endDate}](https://mc.adobe.io/$%7brequestData.tenant%7d/target/activities/$%7brequestData.type%7d/$%7brequestData.activityId%7d/report/performance?reportInterval=$%7brequestData.startDate%7d/$%7brequestData.endDate%7d) to retrieve performance data: They found that the API seems to fail after 50 requests, if we then wait for 30sec to a 1min, then most of the next set of requests will be successful.

Can we know what is the maximum number of requests per second that the customer should make


## Resolution {#resolution}


The maximum number of requests per second that the customer can make is 50/min.

This is a general throttling - per user.
