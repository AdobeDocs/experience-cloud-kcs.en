# Adobe IO for Target: Maximum number of requests per second


When using Adobe IO Target APIs to retrieve change logs and performance data of activities for markets, the requests begin to fail with an HTTP 503 *Service Unavailable error.*It is due to the requests exceeding the maximum limit.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Target

### Issue/Symptoms

You are using Adobe IO Target APIs to retrieve change logs and performance data of activities for your markets.

After many successful requests, your requests begin to fail with an HTTP 503 error of *Service Unavailable*. If you retry these failed requests after a few minutes, they succeed. You are using [https://mc.adobe.io/${requestData.tenant}/target/activities/${requestData.type}/${requestData.activityId}/report/performance?reportInterval=${requestData.startDate}/${requestData.endDate}](https://mc.adobe.io/$%7brequestData.tenant%7d/target/activities/$%7brequestData.type%7d/$%7brequestData.activityId%7d/report/performance?reportInterval=$%7brequestData.startDate%7d/$%7brequestData.endDate%7d) to retrieve performance data: You found that the API seems to fail after 50 requests, if you then wait for 30 sec to 1 min, then most of the next set of requests will be successful.

What is the maximum number of requests per second that can be made?


## Resolution {#resolution}


The maximum number of requests that you can make is 50/min.

This is a general throttling - per user.
