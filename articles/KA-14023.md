# Adobe IO for Target - what is maximum number of requests per second?

## Description


An organization is using Adobe IO Target APIs to retrieve change log and performance data of activities for their markets.

After many successful requests, Their requests begin to fail with a HTTP 503 error of “Service Unavailable”. If customer retry these failed requests after a few minutes, they succeed. The customer is using [https://mc.adobe.io/${requestData.tenant}/target/activities/${requestData.type}/${requestData.activityId}/report/performance?reportInterval=${requestData.startDate}/${requestData.endDate}](https://mc.adobe.io/$%7brequestData.tenant%7d/target/activities/$%7brequestData.type%7d/$%7brequestData.activityId%7d/report/performance?reportInterval=$%7brequestData.startDate%7d/$%7brequestData.endDate%7d) to retrieve performance data: They found that the API seems to fail after 50 requests, if we then wait for 30sec to a 1min, then most of the next set of requests will be successful.

Can we know what is the maximum number of requests per second that the customer should make


## Resolution


The maximum number of requests per second that the customer can make is 50/min.

This is a general throttling - per user.
