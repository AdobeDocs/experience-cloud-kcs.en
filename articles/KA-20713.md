# Load assets in browser on publisher instead of downloading them


Learn about load assets in browser on publisher instead of downloading them by changing the <b>Content-Disposition</b> header of the assets.

## Description {#description}


Some images need to be loaded in the publisher browser but the image is automatically downloaded instead

For example, when an image is published with the link: *publish-pXXXXXX-eYYYYYY.adobeaemcloud.com/content/dam/images/image.png*. One needs to load this image on the browser but by default, it is downloaded.


## Resolution {#resolution}


In order to load the assets instead of downloading them, the <b>Content-Disposition</b> header of the assets needs to be "*inline*" instead of "*attachment*".

This is configured at the dispatcher level by adding the configuration below in the custom vhost file:




> `<` LocationMatch "\/content\/dam.\*\.(jpg|png|txt|pdf).\*"`>`
> 
> Header unset "Content-Disposition"
> 
> Header set Content-Disposition inline
> 
> `<` /LocationMatch`>`
