# Adobe Journey Optimizer: ERR_AUTHORING_JOURNEYVERSION_201

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b>
Adobe Journey Optimizer (AJO)


<b>Steps to reproduce</b>
1. You have a published journey with email steps.
2. Make a change to an email.
3. A pop-up appears asking if you want to update the journey.
4. Press update. An error message appears:



```
{\"code\":3000,\"family\":\"SYSTEM_ERROR\",\"message\":\"Inline messages publication has failed\",\"service\":\"vyg-authoring-api\",\"version\":\"«REDACTED»\",\"context\":\"com.adobe.voyager.service.authoring.restapis.v1_0.JourneyVersionsService:1864\",\"uid\":\"«REDACTED»\",\"extraInfo\":{\"validationStatus\":\"error\",\"reason\":\"1 error is currently blocking the publication\",\"errors\":
{\"errorCode\":\"ERR_AUTHORING_JOURNEYVERSION_201\",\"error\":\"Can't republish journey version: personalization on profile attributes in action '«REDACTED»' has changed in the new published message '«REDACTED»'.\"}
}}"
```



## Resolution {#resolution}


Changes were made to journey properties or events properties that were not initially present when the journey was published. Publish a new version of the journey for the changes you are attempting to make.


Cause
- `ERR_AUTHORING_JOURNEYVERSION_201` error means that the usage of contextual attributes has changed in the content (not profile attributes as suggested by the error message).


- `ERR_AUTHORING_JOURNEYVERSION_202` means that the usage of profile attributes has changed in the content.


Note:

- Contextual attributes are used to add personalization based on contextual data from the journey. For example, using details about a location entry to provide information in a message about a specific store's current store hours and promotions.
- Profile attributes are references associated with the profile schema as described in [Adobe Experience Platform Data Model (XDM)](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/xdm/home.html?lang=en) documentation. For example, first name and last name, and nearest store.
