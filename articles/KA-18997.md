# Website domain is blocking the Enhanced Experience Composer or Access Denied when loading sites

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Target

### <b>Issue</b>

This article aims to address some common issues/errors which we face in our Target Enhanced Experienced Composer, for instance:

- Errors like - "*Your website domain is blocking the Enhanced Experience Composer*" or  "*access denied*" errors when loading sites with proxy enabled
- EEC won’t load an internal QA URL that is not accessible on public IP.
- EEC won't load secure pages on your site that uses TLS 1.0. (EEC only).

### EEC issues troubleshooting steps

A. For EEC errors like "*Your website domain is blocking the Enhanced Experience Composer*" or "*EEC won’t load an internal QA URL that is not accessible on public IP*"

Whitelist the following DNS/IPs in case you see *Timeout* or other 400 messages in these requests in the network or under the <b>Console</b> tab in Chrome Developer Tools:

<b>US:</b>
vizproxy-prod-us-2024941706.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com.
54.173.241.58
3.234.111.144

<b>EMEA:</b>
vizproxy-prod-emea-1118976074.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com.
34.246.105.190
34.249.15.238

<b>APAC:</b>
vizproxy-prod-apac-1398366183.ap-northeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com.
52.192.148.53

B. TLS Issue

Follow the below steps to check the TLS version of the website:

1. Right-click on the affected page and open <b>inspect element</b> (developer console).
2. In the developer console, you'll see 3 dots in the rightmost top corner (next to the gear icon). Click on it and expand the <b>more tools</b> option.
3. Select the<b> security</b> option, which shows our TLS version.    ![](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/assets/firefox_more_info_3.png?lang=en)
4. Reach out to Customer Care to change the TLS version if the current version is 1.0
