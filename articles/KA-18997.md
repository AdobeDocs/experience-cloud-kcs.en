# Target: "Your website domain is blocking the Enhanced Experience Composer" or "Access Denied" when loading sites

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Target

<b>Issue</b>
 This article aims to address some common issues/errors which we face in our Target Enhanced Experienced Composer.
 a. Getting errors like - "*Your website domain is blocking the Enhanced Experience Composer*" or  "*access denied*" errors when loading sites with proxy enabled or EEC won’t load an internal QA URL that is not accessible on public IP.
 b. EEC won't load secure pages on your site that uses TLS 1.0. (EEC only).

<b>2.  TLS Issue</b>

<b>Follow the below steps to check the TLS version of the website:</b>

a. Right-click on the affected page and open inspect element (developer console)

b. In the developer console, we can see 3 dots in the rightmost top corner (next to the gear icon). Click on it and expand the more tools option.

c. Select the security option. Under security, we would be able to see our TLS version.
