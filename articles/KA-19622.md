# AP Segments Insights XLS showing 0 views for individual offers

## Description {#description}


<b>Environment</b>
 Adobe Target

<b>Issue</b>
 Why the Segments Insight report XLS downloaded has the individual offers showing N/A and/or 0 views, but the Group users are showing data to my Automated Personalization Activity?


## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Solution</b>
The likely reason is that the activity created was for <b>Offer Group Report</b>.

To have entries counted for individual offers, the solution would be to create metric for click from display location/offer.

You can still use the metric you have with different mbox, but it will only count per activity/traffic type.

To add some extra details, these articles in the Adobe Target Guide can help you to interpret and create <b>Offer Report</b> or <b>Offer Group Report </b>for AP activities:

- [Offer reporting groups in Automated Personalization](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/reports/offer-reporting-groups-in-automated-personalization.html)
- [Create an Automated Personalization activity](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/activities/automated-personalization/create-ap-activity.html)




Refer to the articles above (especially Step 8 of [Create an Automated Personalization activity](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/activities/automated-personalization/create-ap-activity.html)) to ensure that the AP activities are recording Offers or Group Offers when creating a new activity.

At this point, the current AP activity report containing 0â€™s/zeroes is as expected.
