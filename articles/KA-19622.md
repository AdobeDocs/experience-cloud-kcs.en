# AP Segments Insights XLS showing 0 views for Individual Offers

## Description


Why the Segments Insight report XLS downloaded has the individual offers showing N/A and/or 0 views but the Group users are showing data to my [!UICONTROL Automated Personalization] Activity?


## Resolution


The likely reason is that the activity created was for “Offer Group Report”. To have entries counted for individual offers, the solution would be to create metric for click from display location/offer. You can still use the metric you have with different mbox, but it will only count per activity/traffic type.

To add some extra details, these articles can help you to interpret and create “Offer Report" or "Offer Group Report" for AP activities.
- Offer reporting groups in [!UICONTROL Automated Personalization]. 1
- Create an [!UICONTROL Automated Personalization] activity. 2

2 https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/activities/automated-personalization/create-ap-activity.html?lang=en

Please, refer to the articles above (specially the step 8 of 2) to ensure that the AP activities are recording Offers or Group Offers when creating a new activity.

At this point, the current AP activity report containing 0’s its returning as expected.
