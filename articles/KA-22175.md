# Login Error as user not Mapped SSO (Single Sign On)

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Workfront

### Issue/Symptoms

While trying to log in through Workfront using Single Sign-On (SSO), the page is redirected to the Workfront login page. On the web address bar of the login page, an error message stating "user not mapped" is seen.


## Resolution {#resolution}


1. Navigate to the specific user receiving this error in Workfront:
    - [Edit User](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront/using/administration-and-setup/add-users/create-manage-users/edit-a-users-profile.html?lang=en).
    - If there is no user account present, [create a new user](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront/using/administration-and-setup/add-users/create-manage-users/add-users.html?lang=en) account.
2. Verify that the user has a Federation ID listed:
    - Check for the Federation ID.
3. If the Federation ID is blank, follow these steps:.
    - Enter the user's Federation ID (case-sensitive) provided by your Identity Provider.![](assets/60d91e83-e81c-ee11-8f6e-6045bd006268.png)
    - Click <b>Save.</b>
    - Note: The Federation ID is case-sensitive and must match exactly how it is sent to Workfront from your Identity Provider. If you're unsure about the Federation ID or its case-sensitivity, consult your network or IT administrator.
    - Additionally, check for any extra spaces before or after the Federation ID, as they can be the reason for this error.




Optional steps: Audit logs

Use the Audit logs in Workfront as a troubleshooting tool to examine what your Identity Provider is passing over as the Federation ID (Name ID) during the failed login attempt.

1. Click on <b>Setup</b>
2. Go to System `>`  [Audit logs](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront/using/administration-and-setup/add-users/create-manage-users/audit-logs.html?lang=en)
3. Apply filters to display failed login attempts
    - Filter down to failed log in attempts ![](assets/536bf45b-e81c-ee11-8f6e-6045bd006268.png)
    - Click <b>Apply</b>.
4. The Federation ID (Name ID) passed from the Identity Provider to Workfront is displayed in the detail's column for the recent failed login attempt.![](assets/d6dec0af-e81c-ee11-8f6e-6045bd006268.png)
    - Ensure that this Federation ID shown in the detail's column matches exactly (case-sensitive) with what is entered on Workfront as the Federation ID.
