# When are browsers counted in Analytics?

## Description

<b>Environment</b>
- Customer Journey Analytics
- Analytics



<b>Issues/Symptoms</b>
At what point in a visit does browser and OS get counted?


## Resolution


Analytics only looks up/processes OS (operating system) and Browser on the first hit of a visit. The os and browser then are persisted through the visit. This *CAN*mean that raw data may not match the UI as raw data will show the OS and browser at a hit level where the UI will use the OS and Browser from the first hit of a visit.
