# When are browsers counted in Analytics?

## Description


At want point in a visit does browser and OS get counted?


## Resolution


Analytics only looks up/processes OS (operating system) and Browser on the first hit of a visit. The os and browser then are persisted through the visit. This CAN mean that raw data may not match the UI as raw data will show the OS and browser at a hit level where the UI will use the OS and Browser from the first hit of a visit.
