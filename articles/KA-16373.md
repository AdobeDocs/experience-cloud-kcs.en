# Campaign Classic - Is IPv6 supported on Adobe Campaign Classic?

## Description {#description}

<br><br>Environment<br><br>
- Campaign Classic (On Prem)

<br><br>Issue<br><br>Is IPv6 supported on Adobe Campaign Classic?<br><br> <br><br>

## Resolution {#resolution}


IPv6 is fully supported. Adobe Campaign accepts IPv6 IP for whitelisting and access to Campaign.

IPv4 Addresses are only for sending email. As many providers are not ready to receive IPv6 emails, we can’t guarantee a good deliverability rate with IPv6.
