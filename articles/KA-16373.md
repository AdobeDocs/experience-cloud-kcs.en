# Campaign Classic - Is IPv6 supported on Adobe Campaign Classic?

## Description

<br><br>Is IPv6 supported on Adobe Campaign Classic?<br><br> <br><br>

## Resolution


IPv6 is fully supported. Adobe Campaign accepts IPv6 IP for whitelisting and access to [!DNL Campaign].

IPv4 Addresses are only for sending email. As many providers are not ready to receive IPv6 emails, we can’t guarantee a good deliverability rate with IPv6.
