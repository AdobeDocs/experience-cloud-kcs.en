# New resource resolver search path breaks template policies


Adding a resource resolver search path `/apps/proj1` via script disrupts all policies set in `/conf/proj1/settings/wcm/policies`. Conversely, eliminating the`/apps/proj1` line from the `cfg.json` script restores the policies to their former functional state. Follow the instructions in the article to fix this problem.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager 6.5



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Add a resource resolver search path `("/apps/proj1")` through script:


```
org.apache.sling.jcr.resource.internal.JcrResourceResolverFactoryImpl.cfg.json

{

"resource.resolver.searchpath":

"/apps/proj1",

"/apps",

"/libs"

}
```


This breaks all policies defined in `/conf/proj1/settings/wcm/policies`

Definitions in `policies.xml` exist, but it is impossible to relate them to editable page templates, and all previous policy selections in templates are broken. Only removing the line `'/apps/proj1'` from the `cfg.json` script, gets the defined policies back to the previous working state.

This can be reproduced using the following steps:
<br> <br><br>
1. Create any policy related to a specific component on a specific page template.


2. Save the template with the chosen policy.


3. Add script with:

    ```
    resource.resolver.searchpath":
            
            "/apps/projname"...
    ```


4. Confirm that the defined policy for the template and related component can no longer be selected in the dropdown on edit template.



## Resolution {#resolution}


As best practice, avoid amending `/apps` and `/libs`. Sling would look for components First in `/apps`, then `/libs`.

Sling will search for resources by going through this list in order. This means that items in */apps* (unless specified using */libs* at the beginning of the path) will be found first. This is how the overlay works.
