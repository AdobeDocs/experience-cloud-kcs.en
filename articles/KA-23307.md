# The ffdaUnicity workflow fails with ODB-240000 error


The workflow *ffdaUnicity* fails with the following error:

*ODB-240000 Error ODBC : SQL compilation error: Object 'XXXXX' does not exist or not authorized. SQLState: 42S02*

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Campaign Classic v8

### Issue/Symptoms

The audit logs show that the workflow *ffdaUnicity* fails with an error on the JavaScript activity -- `check for all custom schemas AND "nms:recipient"`.

<u>Error</u>:

*ODB-240000 Error ODBC : SQL compilation error: Object 'XXXXX' does not exist or not authorized. SQLState: 42S02*


## Resolution {#resolution}


Depending on whether you want the table to be created or not, you can apply either of these solutions:

- Run the *Update Database Structure*wizard to create the table.
- Delete the schema if you don't want to create the table.


### Cause

The error occurs because a schema is created in ACC, but the *Update Database Structure*wizard hasn't been run for it, so the table of the schema doesn't exist in the database.
