# Pipeline deployment failing due to repoinit error "Cannot set ACL on non-existent path .."

## Description {#description}


<b>Description</b>:

Pipeline deployment is failing during the buildImage step, and the following error (or similar) is seen in theÂ buildImage.log:
 \*ERROR\* `[` Apache Sling Repository Startup Thread #1`]`  com.adobe.granite.repository.impl.SlingRepositoryManager Exception in a SlingRepositoryInitializer, SlingRepository service registration aborted
 javax.jcr.RepositoryException: Applying repoinit operation failed despite retry; set loglevel to DEBUG to see all exceptions. Last exception message was: Failed to set ACL (javax.jcr.PathNotFoundException: Cannot set ACL on non-existent path `<` masked_path`>` ) AclLine DENY {paths=`[` `<` masked_path`>` `]` , privileges=`[` jcr:all`]` }
 ...
 Caused by: org.apache.sling.jcr.repoinit.impl.RepoInitException: Failed to set ACL (javax.jcr.PathNotFoundException: Cannot set ACL on non-existent path `<` masked_path`>` ) AclLine DENY {paths=`[` `<` masked_path`>` `]` , privileges=`[` jcr:all`]` }
 ...
 Caused by: javax.jcr.PathNotFoundException: Cannot set ACL on non-existent path `<` masked_path`>`


## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Solution:</b>

The `<` masked_path`>`  might not exist on the golden master `[` 0`]`  (a specialized publish node) when the repoinit script is run.
To fix this error, you can create the `<` masked_path`>`  in the repoinit script <b>before</b> assigning the ACL.
