## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment</b>

Adobe Experience Manager as Cloud Service



### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

Pipeline deployment fails during the buildImage step, and the following error (or similar) is seen in the `buildImage.log`:

<b>ERROR</b>


```
Apache Sling Repository Startup Thread #1]  com.adobe.granite.repository.impl.SlingRepositoryManager Exception in a SlingRepositoryInitializer, SlingRepository service registration abortedjavax.jcr.RepositoryException: Applying repoinit operation failed despite retry; set loglevel to DEBUG to see all exceptions. Last exception message was: Failed to set ACL (javax.jcr.PathNotFoundException: Cannot set ACL on non-existent path <masked_path>) AclLine DENY {paths=[ <masked_path>] , privileges=[ jcr:all] }Caused by: org.apache.sling.jcr.repoinit.impl.RepoInitException: Failed to set ACL (javax.jcr.PathNotFoundException: Cannot set ACL on non-existent path <masked_path>) AclLine DENY {paths=[ <masked_path>] , privileges=[ jcr:all] }Caused by: javax.jcr.PathNotFoundException: Cannot set ACL on non-existent path <masked_path>
```



## Resolution {#resolution}


To fix this error, create the `<masked_path>` in the repoinit script before assigning the ACL.

<br>Cause:<br>
The `<masked_path>` might not exist on the golden master (a specialized publish node) when the repoinit script is run.
