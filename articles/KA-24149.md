# Unable to create viewer presets in AEMaaCS

## Description {#description}


<b>Description</b> :

 We are not able to create Viewer Preset in AEMaaCS environment.
 we are even not able to see any existing Viewer Presets either.


## Resolution {#resolution}


DynamicMedia setup settings were mixed up, some referring to a staging DMS7 instance, some to production. This mismatch prevented the ViewerPresets from showing up.

Load the DM maintenance page here on the AEMaaCS instance concerned:

/libs/dam/gui/content/s7dam/samplemanager/samplemanager.html

From that page, run "DM initial sync" and any other setup scripts as necessary to create the presets the way they are supposed to be and then make sure the viewer presets can now be seen and used and new ones created as necessary.
