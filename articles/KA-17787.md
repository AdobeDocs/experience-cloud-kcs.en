# Adobe Campaign Standard: Cannot delete custom resource

## Description


It has been reported that in rare instances where clients who created custom resources using the deprecated Adobe Campaign Classic (ACC) to ACS prime connector can not delete custom resources after being migrated entirely to ACS.

This is due to the fact that the control over the custom resources was supposed to be done from the ACC side so the resource cannot be re-drafted in ACS.


## Resolution


To allow for the schema to be re-drafted and deleted it needs to be updated by Adobe Tech-Ops.

The command to execute is as follows:

instanceName= update xtkcusresource set icusresourcesetid=0 where sname='schema' and iissnapshot=0; UPDATE 1

This updates the origin of the schema from ACSConnect to ACS and will allow it to be re-drafted and dropped.
