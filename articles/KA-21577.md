## Resolution {#resolution}


This failure is a customer code failure that needs to be resolved by updating the node version in a failed module using npm. To make this change your customer needs to do the following:

1. Find the node version that is being used in reactor `pom.xml`. Below example = 16.14.0 `pom.xml`:<br>

    ```
    <configuration>
            <nodeVersion>v16.14.0</nodeVersion>. 
            <npmVersion>8.3.1</npmVersion>
        <configuration>
    ```


2. Add this node version as <b>devDependencies</b> in the `package.json` file of the module that failed to build. In the above example, it is UI Frontend.    


    BEFORE - `package.json`:


    ```
    "devDependencies": {
        "@babel/core": "7.0.0",
        "@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties": "7.3.3",
        "@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread": "7.3.2",
        "@material/tab-bar": "12.0.0",
        },
    ```

    


    AFTER - `package.json`:


    ```
    "devDependencies": {
        "@types/node": "16.14.0",                          THIS LINE WAS ADDED
        "@babel/core": "7.0.0",
        "@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties": "7.3.3",
        "@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread": "7.3.2",
        "@material/tab-bar": "12.0.0",
        },
    ```
