# Campaign Classic - Is there any UI interface available to access the SFTP without any SFTP tools?

## Description


Is there any UI interface available to access the SFTP without any SFTP tools in case the customer might not have access to SFTP tools?


## Resolution


If you want to connect to an SFTP server, a tool is required. You can use free online tools.

If you want to access information about your Adobe hosted SFTP (space used, IPs whitelisted), you can use the Adobe Control Panel interface available in the Adobe Experience Cloud.
