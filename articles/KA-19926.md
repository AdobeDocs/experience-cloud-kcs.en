# If a dataset is not enabled for Profile, how does that impact segmentation?

## Description {#description}

<b>Environment</b><br><br>Experience Platform<br><br><b>Issue/Symptoms</b><br><br>If a dataset is not enabled for Profile, will the data included in that dataset shall not be considered for segmentation qualification (even if we have an Identity specified in that dataset/schema)?<br>

## Resolution {#resolution}


No, it will not be considered at all, this is how the Experience Platform operates. Segmentation works on the UPS (Unified Profile Service) level, not at Data Lake level.

If Profile is not enabled, the data coming into the Data Lake does not get promoted to the Unified Profile and Identity Services.
