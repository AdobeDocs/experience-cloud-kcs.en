# AEP - If a dataset is not enabled for Profile, how does that impact segmentation?

## Description

If a dataset is not enabled for Profile, is the data included in that dataset not considered for segmentation qualification (even if we have an Identity specified in that dataset / schema)?

## Resolution


No it is not considered at all, this is howÂ Experience Platform operates. Segmentation works on the UPS (Unified Profile Service) level, not at Data Lake level.

If Profile is not enabled, the data coming into the Data Lake does not get promoted to the Unified Profile and Identity Services
