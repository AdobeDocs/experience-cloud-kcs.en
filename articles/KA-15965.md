# Campaign Classic: Error when making call to AAM

## Description


While selecting a shared audience in campaign and hitting save, an error is thrown on Campaign.

Error while creating the mapping for the 'xxxxxxx' segment


## Resolution


Usually this issue occurs when:

1. The user logged into Campaign has not been assigned the product "Audience Library" within Adobe Experience Cloud Admin Console.

2. The Tenant specified in the Adobe Experience Cloud External Account inside Campaign is not correct.

In this case, after the server url was changed from "https://marketing.adobe.com" to "https://experiencecloud.adobe.com" the issue was resolved.
