# Adobe Campaign Standard:

## Description

It has been reported that in some instances, searching on an email field within the Profile Search UI doesn't display, however when executing the same search from a workflow the results display.

It has been found that when the Profiles schema has been extended and a 1:1 relationship with a custom schema has been made, that if the profile in question doesn't have the required key field on the custom schema that the search won't return any results. Â 

## Resolution

As it stands, an enhancement has been submitted as CAMP-38229 for the Profile search functionality to be able to handle the 1 to 1 relationship.

That said modifying the link type to 1:0 or 0 type link then republishing the changes should allow the profiles to be seen.
