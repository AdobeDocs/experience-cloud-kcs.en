# Experience Platform Data Collection - error when I add a custom event to a rule 'has maximum number of rule components'


Error Â 'has maximum number of rule components' comes up when adding events to a rule in an Experience Platform Data Collection property

## Description {#description}


*Tags in Adobe Experience Platform follow a rule-based system
<br>Events (If): The event is what you want the rule to look for. This is defined by choosing an event, any applicable conditions, and any exceptions.*

You are trying to add a condition (event) to a property rule which already has a high number of those conditions but get an error upon saving your changes, as illustrated in the below screenshot

## Resolution {#resolution}


There is a limit of about 100 events / conditions you can add into a Data Collection rule in Adobe Tags.

The general consensus however is that having such a large amount of rule conditions is very unusual and the current limit is unlikely to be raised. If this is something you really need, then we would encourage the use of custom code and a select case statement.
