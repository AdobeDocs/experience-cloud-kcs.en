# Manual Translation Job stuck with status "In progress"


If the manual translation job is still stuck with the status *In progress*, ensure that the `sourcePath` in your imported XML files precisely matches the paths specified in your translation job.

## Description {#description}


### Environment

Adobe Experience Manager



### Issue/Symptoms

Manual Translation Job stuck with status *In progress*.

When importing translated content into an AEM translation job, you may encounter an issue where the translation status remains *In progress*.  To address this, follow the [export/import process](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/sites/administering/reusing-content/translation/managing-projects.html#import-export)documented in the AEM as a cloud service user guide.



To troubleshoot this issue, follow these steps:



1. Check the translation job status for each path added to the job by clicking the three dots symbol of the translation job card. Take note of the paths and their respective statuses.
2. Compare the imported XML files with the XML files from the original export.
3. Ensure that the `sourcePath=` in the translationObjectFile element matches the paths seen in step 1.





## Resolution {#resolution}


The job will stay *In progress* if the `sourcePath=` in the imported XML files does NOT match the paths from the translation job.

It must be made sure that the same source paths in the translation job match those in the imported XML files.
