# Manual Translation Job stuck with status "In progress"


A translation job is stuck "In progress" after importing its translated content.

## Description {#description}


When importing translated content into a translation job in AEM the translation status remains stuck In Progress. The export/import process is documented here:

[https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/sites/administering/reusing-content/translation/managing-projects.html?lang=en#import-export](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/sites/administering/reusing-content/translation/managing-projects.html?lang=en#import-export)



Troubleshooting steps:

1. Verify the translation job status of each path added to the job by clicking the three dots symbol of the translation job card. Check and take note of the paths and the statuses displayed.

2. Compare the imported XML files with the XML files from the original export.

3. The "sourcePath=" in theÂ translationObjectFile element must match the paths seen in point 1.




## Resolution {#resolution}


The job will remain "In progress" if the "sourcePath=" in the imported XML files does NOT match the paths from the translation job.

Customers need to ensure that <b>the same source paths</b> in the translation job are also present in the translated XML files when importing the files.
