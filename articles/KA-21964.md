2. Go to the customResourceA custom resource and <b>cancel </b>the re-draft.

4. Go to the custom resources (customResourceB, customResourceC, etc.) and <b>unlink</b> customResourceA.
5. <b>Publish</b> the resources.
6. Go to the customResourceA and <b>re-draft.</b>
7. Go to the custom resources (customResourceB, customResourceC, etc.) and check the <b>do not synchronize</b> box.
8. <b>Publish</b> the resources.

In the custom resource's data, there are records with null values which could not be deleted from the UI or through a workflow.
