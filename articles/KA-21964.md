To resolve the error and remove the null records, all<b> </b>custom resources that have a link to the custom resource mentioned in the error must be found.

Example below:

1. Click on the custom resources (customResourceB, customResourceC, .etc.) with a link to customResourceA and uncheck the <b>do not synchronize</b> box.
2. Go to the customResourceA custom resource and <b>cancel </b>the re-draft.
3. <b>Publish</b> the resources.
4. Go to the custom resources (customResourceB, customResourceC, etc.) and <b>unlink</b> customResourceA.
5. <b>Publish</b> the resources.
6. Go to the customResourceA and <b>re-draft.</b>
7. Go to the custom resources (customResourceB, customResourceC, etc.) and check the <b>do not synchronize</b> box.
8. <b>Publish</b> the resources.

<br>CausesÂ <br>
In the custom resource's data, there are records with null values which could not be deleted from the UI or through a workflow.
