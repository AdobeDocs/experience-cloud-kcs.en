# Schema Definition Not Found - Unable to generate from schema error

## Description {#description}


Errors have been reported that some users are unable to re-draft and publish the custom resource (Example: customResourceA). When going to the custom resource's data, it is noticed that there are records with null values which could not be deleted from the UI or through a workflow.



When attempting to re-draft and publish, errors are received:


| Error while executing the method 'GenerateCusResource' of service 'xtk:builder'. |
| --- |
| 'cpmcustomResourceA' schema definition not found. Unable to generate from schema 'cus:customResourceA'. |





## Resolution {#resolution}


To resolve the error and remove the null records, all<b> </b>custom resources that have a link to the custom resource mentioned in the error must be found.

Example below:

1) Go to the custom resources (customResourceB, customResourceC, ..., etc.) with a link to customResourceA and uncheck the "Do not synchronize" box.

2) Go to the customResourceA custom resource and cancel the re-draft.

3) Publish the resources.

4) Go to the custom resources (customResourceB, customResourceC, ..., etc.) and unlink customResourceA.

5) Publish the resources.

6) Go to the customResourceA and re-draft.

7) Go to the custom resources (customResourceB, customResourceC, ..., etc.) and check the "Do not synchronize" box.

8) Publish the resources.
