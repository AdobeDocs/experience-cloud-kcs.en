# The page URL skips link tracking calls


Learn how to solve the Customer Journey Analytics Analytics issue where a page URL with 'mid' query parameter falls into the 'Email' channel. Check if the server call type is [link tracking](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/functions/tl-method.html?lang=en) such as Custom link instead of page view.

## Description {#description}


### <b> Environment</b>

- Customer Journey Analytics
- Analytics




### <b>Issues/Symptoms</b>

If there is a Marketing Channel processing rule like below, it should fall into the 'Email' channel if a page URL has 'mid' Query String Parameter.
 However, in some cases, a page URL with 'mid' query parameter like the one shown below may be ignored by the 'Email' channel and fall into another one.

## Resolution {#resolution}




Check if the server call type is [link tracking](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/functions/tl-method.html?lang=en) such as Custom link instead of page view. If it is a link tracking call, it is working as designed.




<br>Cause:<br>
Adobe data collection servers strip the pageURL dimension from all [link tracking](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/functions/tl-method.html?lang=en) image requests. As such, the page URL matching rule won't work with link tracking calls.
