# Why does the page URL skip link tracking calls

## Description {#description}

<b> Environment</b>
- Adobe Analytics



<b>Issues/Symptoms</b>
Suppose you have a Marketing Channel processing rule like below, it should fall into the 'Email' channel if a page URL has 'mid' Query String Parameter.
 However, in some cases, a page URL with 'mid' query parameter like the one shown below may be ignored by the 'Email' channel and fall into another one.
 `[` 1`]`  [http://www.example.com/home.html?mid=123](http://www.example.com/home.html?mid=123)

## Resolution {#resolution}




Check if the server call type is [link tracking](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/functions/tl-method.html?lang=en) such as Custom link instead of page view. If it is a link tracking call, it is working as designed.





Root Cause:

Adobe data collection servers strip the pageURL dimension from all [link tracking](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/functions/tl-method.html?lang=en) image requests. As such, the page URL matching rule won't work with link tracking calls.

Here is a little more information about pageURL's [https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/page-vars/pageurl.html?lang=en](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/page-vars/pageurl.html?lang=en)
