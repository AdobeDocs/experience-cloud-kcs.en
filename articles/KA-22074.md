# Activate Brand Portal using OAuth Sever-to-Server credentials

## Description {#description}


<b>Description</b> :

The customer is using <b>OAuth Sever-to-Server credentials</b> method via the Developer Console and the documentation `[` 1`]`  mentions using the old JWT credentials method in order to create the Adobe IMS Technical Account Configuration. So, how should they proceed?

 `[` 1`]`  https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/brand-portal/configure-aem-assets-with-brand-portal.html?lang=en#manual-configuration




## Resolution {#resolution}


<b>Resolution:</b>

Currently, BrandPortal is still using JWT.

OAuth server-to-server is not supported. The existing JWT-based integration will continue to work till 2024. Users can still create new JWT-based integrations until May 2024.
