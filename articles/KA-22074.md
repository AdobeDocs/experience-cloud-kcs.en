# Activate Brand Portal using OAuth Sever-to-Server credentials

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment </b>

- Experience Manager
- Experience Manager as Cloud Service


### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>
<br>The customer is using the <b>OAuth Sever-to-Server credentials</b> method via the Developer Console. The documentation `[` 1`]`  mentions using the old JWT credentials method in order to create the Adobe IMS Technical Account Configuration.

<br> 




## Resolution {#resolution}




Follow this [step-by-step guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/brand-portal/configure-aem-assets-with-brand-portal.html?lang=en#manual-configuration) to configure experience manager assets with the brand portal.



Currently, <b>BrandPortal</b> is still using JWT.

Whereas OAuth server-to-server is not supported. The existing JWT-based integration will continue to work till 2024. Users can still create new JWT-based integrations until May 2024.
