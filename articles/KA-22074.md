# Cannot activate BrandPortal using OAuth Server-to-Server credentials


BrandPortal currently relies on JWT. The OAuth server-to-server authentication protocol is not supported.

## Description {#description}


### <b>Environment </b>

- Experience Manager
- Experience Manager as Cloud Service


### <b>Issue/Symptoms</b>

You are trying to figure out how to connect AEM Brand portal with AEM, as the use of JWT tokens with AEM products will no longer be supported after May 2024.




## Resolution {#resolution}




The existing JWT-based integration will continue to function until 2024. You can still create new JWT-based integrations until May 2024.  To create a service account (JWT) connection, follow these [steps](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/brand-portal/configure-aem-assets-with-brand-portal.html?lang=en#createnewintegration) in the AEM as a Cloud Server User Guide.



To complete the process to configure experience manager assets with the brand portal, refer to [Manual configuration using Adobe Developer Console](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/brand-portal/configure-aem-assets-with-brand-portal.html?lang=en#manual-configuration) in the AEM as a Cloud Server User Guide.
